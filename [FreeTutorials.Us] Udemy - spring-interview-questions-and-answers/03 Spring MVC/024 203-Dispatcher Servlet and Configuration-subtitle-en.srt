Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,000
In this video let's talk a little bit about how you can configure your dispatcher so late in the previous

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,780
We deal with dog.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,440
Dispatcher So will it being different controller.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,040
So any questions spring NBC would first come to the dispatcher Solet and dispatcher so it would then

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,400
look at the handler mappings and be directed to the appropriate control.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,990
And when I'm sending the view back as well from the control I would get the name dispatch table it would

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,300
map it to a physical view by using the beautiful word and then exclude the view and return the data

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:33,650
back.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,680
So that basically the entire floor where the dispatcher said.

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,020
Right.

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,510
So how do you set up a dispatcher.

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,070
That's the question that we would discuss.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,060
Now if you look at the dispatcher Sublette it's configured in very similar.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,820
So anywhere we are configuring us of late.

16
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,610
So we are creating a normal service to this.

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,720
It should be possible that which is being configured in their product segment we're passing one of the

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,110
bad ammeters department is we are passing in is the location obvious pring context where is us in context

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:09,910
present in this application this being context is present at Rabanne of Crucible takes him at this ex-American

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,190
paints the bad pring context that is needed to run that web application.

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,530
And once you configure the dispatcher dispatcher serviette then what we need to do is to map as you

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,090
are able to it here.

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,190
Did you at least map to it.

24
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:33,830
So the other option is to map slash spring NBC or slash EPA or slash whatever you want to be.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,410
So in this first reconfiguration of their backs and then all requests would go to the dispatcher certainly

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,950
any request would first go to the dispatcher.

27
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,590
This is how you can figure dispatchers servlet in a typical web application.

28
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:56,100
However if you are using springboard then you would not need to do this configuration at all because

29
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:02,060
springboard has this feature called Ardo configuration wherein as soon as you add in spring where NBC

30
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,530
Jard into the class.

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,030
But it would see that it would know that you are trying get out of a web application and it would auto

32
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,910
configure dispatches late for you.

33
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,470
So if you are using basic spring unzipping NBC and here's how you do the configuration if you do it

34
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,020
using springboard then dispatcher so it would be configured for you.

35
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,940
And then the next step.

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,220
Bewray.
