1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:07,480
Welcome back in this you we'll talk about form form validation and other such features which can be

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,300
implemented with spring NBC.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,180
So what do we mean by a form so let's say I want to update this particular to do so.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:20,410
I would want to enter some details here and I would want to change the target date to 29.

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:28,000
And I would want to submit this in here what we would need to do is in here we would need to create

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,740
a form.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,030
So this is basically a form which contains two fields which are present in here.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,560
The other thing is we want to do in the form is to add validation.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:43,060
So I would want to add validations which says I would want to at least have six characters in the description.

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,420
So this is what is called validation.

11
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:51,790
I want to be able to implement this validation on the server side so I don't want client side validation

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,180
for this.

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,560
I would want to be able to implement this validation on the Java side of things.

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,070
So in this video let's look at how sping MVC would enable you to do such kind of things will disclose

15
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,510
all the interview questions which are related to these concepts.

16
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,320
Let's start with the first question which is form backing object.

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,440
So this is the form right to represent this form in spring.

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,840
You would need to have something called a Form backing object.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,420
So form backing object is basically the backend representation the suicide representation of this form.

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:31,210
The table in which this form is map is called the form backing or object or here.

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,180
If you look at the control I'm sure to page you're adding an attribute called to do.

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,260
So we are saying to do what.

23
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,200
To do that is being added with the default one.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,710
So this is the new page when I go to the Toulouse and say add this is a new page.

25
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,470
So if you look at the description it's empty and the target date is today's date.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,550
How are we getting it.

27
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:59,540
Because we are adding this as the form backing object we are seeing to use the form backing object.

28
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,740
The details are zero.

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,550
I'm also adding a description of him.

30
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:12,670
And that in today's date as the what would happen is that to do would be written back and Truda or just

31
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,460
be would be shown to use the name of The View.

32
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:24,010
And if you look at the GSB command name which is used here is to do so we are saying this to do in here.

33
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:33,940
This object should be mapped to this form so any form the description DSG field to do maps to this particular

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,710
description field.

35
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,790
The target date maps to this specific thing.

36
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,210
So we are basically mapping the form backing objects so we are saying this is the object.

37
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,690
And this is how it relates to the form.

38
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:54,510
And what happens when you click the submit button is we would again map that particular thing to the

39
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,810
to do in here.

40
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,120
So we are mapping it again.

41
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,670
So this is the app to do matter which gets invoked when a pause to happen.

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,790
So here you see slash at the do.

43
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,590
And the method is both.

44
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,160
So when the Post happens this basic method is invoked.

45
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,940
And what we are doing in here is we are trying to add that to do so we are trying to get the description

46
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,760
we're trying to add the To Do list of tools that we have.

47
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,490
And then we add rededicating to the list to do speech.

48
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,300
This is the normal flow.

49
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,730
Now we also saw that there was a violation that is getting triggered.

50
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,250
How is it implemented using sping NBC.

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,250
What I we need to do is to implement validation.

52
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:40,380
You need to use something called Jowler validation EPA and the default intimidation for job abolishing

53
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,820
EPA IIS hibernate data.

54
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,540
We're using a few annotations from it here.

55
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:53,530
So if I want to do validation what I'll do is I can actually go here and say at size and say this description

56
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:59,920
field should have a minimum of six characters and this is the message which should be shown if that

57
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,140
feeds.

58
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,570
So what we're doing here is we are adding validation to bean directly.

59
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,560
So I wanted to do a class on it to be in.

60
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,520
We are adding a validation.

61
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,200
So this is adding a validation on the B into excises.

62
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,270
One of the annotations which had rallied as far as Jallow abolition EPA is concerned.

63
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,030
And what we would do is on the bean.

64
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,610
So all here what we are doing at valid to what we are saying is we added and at the annotation on that

65
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,930
to do so when data from the form gets mapped.

66
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,770
Here we are saying validated by putting D at the end of.

67
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,280
And one more thing which we are adding in is the binding result.

68
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,660
What happens when I click submit.

69
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,440
Here what happens is that fill up a couple of details is the answer.

70
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:02,550
What happens is the values from here get bound to this specific method to the to do and what happens

71
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,850
also is that devaluation gets invoked and the result of the validation gets stored in something called

72
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,680
a binding resurged result.

73
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:18,410
If there are no errors if Brazil has errors then we are redirecting him to the to do page again.

74
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,320
So what we are doing is we are sending them back to the to do page.

75
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,160
There are no errors then we would want to add to do in.

76
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,110
So what we are doing is we added our evaluation on the bean then under control of controller method

77
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:37,740
we said at the rally and we took the binding result and we did it redirected it to digest.

78
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,270
How do we display validation errors on the JCP it's by using springform bag.

79
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:51,060
It's by using form Arabs and saying show the errors for that field what field description field.

80
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,930
So what happens is spring NBC would map the error which comes back over here and we would get to see

81
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:03,840
the validation message in here a little bit of a roundabout kind of thing.

82
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,080
So what we are doing to implement validation in here is be implemented on the bean in the control method.

83
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,140
We would add that really the annotation and the result get stored in binding result we check whether

84
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,210
there are any errors if there are errors.

85
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,380
We did it back to the same page and in the same page we have the form errors which display the errors

86
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,360
in here.

87
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,060
So if you look at validation which is implemented by this being an important concept we talked about

88
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:36,420
our binding result and also have your map validation details if you will that both of them are binding

89
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,740
result is the result of the validation on the controller.

90
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,000
So the controller it's in that is stored in here.

91
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,460
And the way we display the arrows on the view is by using the form spec.

92
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,560
We also look at some of the springform tags in our view.

93
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,040
Right.

94
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,440
So this is the label.

95
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,510
So this label is whatever is shown on the screen.

96
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,330
Right.

97
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:06,150
So this is the label which is shown in bold That's the label the input is input field and also the form

98
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:12,860
input which is present in here so form form is used to create and form some of the important springform

99
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,660
tags are fome fome fome label form input form letters and things like that.

100
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:24,330
In this video we looked at how do you back a farm using sping MVC using a farm backing object.

101
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,900
And also we looked at the basics of how validations are done using spelling bees and in the next video

102
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,290
we're.
