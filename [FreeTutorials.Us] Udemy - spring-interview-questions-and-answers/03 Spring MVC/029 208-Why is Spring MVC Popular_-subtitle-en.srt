00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,570
In this last week on sping and we would be discussing about why is NBC so popular.

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:13,500
One of the most important things I like about being in the U.S. is the clear separation of concerns.

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,620
So you have a dispatcher servlet you have your controllers you have you have your duties all worse you

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:23,860
have your views modelled and views you have your controller side your moral attribute.

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:31,020
You have your station attribute all these are completely independent of each other.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,920
So each of these concepts are handled one thing and they do that really really well.

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,860
It helps me to develop a web application very easily as well as it helps me to unit their stuff very

8
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,410
easily as well.

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:53,870
I think the clear separation of Canton's which is being MVC brings in is one of the most important reasons

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,300
why spring NBC is really popular.

11
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,580
The important thing to understand is springing busy is not only used to develop applications but it's

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,360
also used to daily press with Web services.

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,590
So the section on being NBC actually does not end here.

14
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,480
Bill talk a lot about its full web services later.

15
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:20,550
And during that section we will talk a lot more about putting NBC and also about RESTful services and

16
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,760
then the next we do.
