1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,090
Come back and this we do let's look at how you can implement common logic for all the controllers and

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,280
paying him you see.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,360
We'll talk about something called controlled Airways and exception handling is something you would want

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,960
to commonly implement across all the controllers.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,160
So we'll talk about it a little bit.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:25,220
We'll also look at questions like how to handle exceptions for web applications and how do you implement

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,690
exceptionality What are the important things to think about as well as how do you implement to speak

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,430
error handling for a specific control that meant that what you're looking at in the screen right now

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,090
is an example exception controller.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,280
Important advice which is present in here is something call at controller Ed wise.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,240
So this is the annotation that control read is the annotation when you want to implement logic which

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,200
is common to many people controllers.

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:59,930
So this is a place to all the controllers which are present in your application and the ways to which

14
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:05,160
we are specifically implementing in here is at exception handler.

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:12,800
What we're saying is we are defining exception handling for anything of exception class any exception

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:20,470
that happens in the application of exception or any of subtypes would be handled by this method.

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,150
So what we were doing in here is when an exception happens in the application in any of the controllers.

18
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,620
It would be handled by this method because we are saying it can tolerate.

19
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,520
Why is it applicable to all the controllers inside the application.

20
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,790
And here we are saying.

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,080
Handle exception dark is actually here.

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,250
You can also ask with very specific exceptions.

23
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,960
So if you want to say to do not found exception and you would want to handle that separately you can

24
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,770
actually have a separate implementation for that as well.

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,820
Or here what we are doing here is actually logging it into the request and returning the error.

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,300
So we are saying show the error.

27
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,940
So this will lead to error charges.

28
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,130
So it will go to the error not just be and display the error dogies speak to the user.

29
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,660
This is a web application right.

30
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,140
Whenever an error happened.

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,610
What we want to do we want to show an error page to the user.

32
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,520
So this would handle the exception and it would show an error page to the user.

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,440
How do you implement common logic for controllers thing and we see that's implemented by using control

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,810
of headways control headways is used to implement common logic.

35
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,810
Exception handling in the last VBA will indeed bind.

36
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,840
So we can also use control of advice to implement it bind.

37
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,530
And we look at exception handler with the exception handler.

38
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,490
In addition we'll be able to define how to handle a specific exception.

39
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:55,250
So if we can limit that is throwing any exception then that's an exception handler helps us to handle

40
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:55,810
that.

41
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,310
You don't want to have a common exception handling all the method.

42
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,540
And if you want to have specific exception handling then you can actually have the same method as an

43
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,990
in your normally control.

44
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:13,010
So if I take my two controller and put this method in then this exception handling is applicable only

45
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,230
for this specific controller.

46
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,560
Why don't we talk about exception handling with respect to web applications.

47
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,020
The important thing to make sure is know what happens if you don't show a photo for or something of

48
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:30,830
that kind to the end user or you do want to show a proper error page and one of the important best practices

49
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,200
is also give him a handle to ID.

50
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,640
So kind of generate a random number in here or a sequence of numbers is fine as well.

51
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,770
So kind of have a sequence of numbers and give him an ID.

52
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,790
And what you can do is use the ID and log all the information you have about that exception in here.

53
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,420
So make sure that the the user gets all the details.

54
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:00,230
That's number one make sure that the developer has enough details in the log present to handle that

55
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,190
exception.

56
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,860
So those are the two important things you need to think about when you are implementing exception handling

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,830
in your applications.

58
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,420
In this video we looked at how to implement common logic for controllers.

59
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,940
We looked at exception handling as a specific example of that.

60
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,330
And next would you say.
