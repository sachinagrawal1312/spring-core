1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:07,610
Let's look at some of the other basics which are related to being an easy pathway with moral attribute

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,920
and sation it when to use a pathway Deeble It's very simple right.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,600
So you have a huge array to do with Flash 1 and I would want to map it to obey you but I would want

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,840
to make it mapped to a controller radio but so here have to do is one of the methods which is present

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,020
inside the controller and mapping it to the jewelry.

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,740
Slash traduce slash ID so you can see that IDS inside of variable in here.

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,760
What happens is I would want to map this one to this DVD.

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,580
But in those kind of situations I would use something called.

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:48,860
But really what are we seeing here as part of the quest you are Roy is part Duilia able to hear the

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,830
value here.

11
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,980
We would want to take it and put it into our pot.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,060
But in these kind of situations we use and in addition call it part variable.

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,500
And the important thing is to declare a billiard ball in this format.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:07,550
So in the open races close races I put the ID and the ID maps to this part with the built in here would

15
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:13,460
be in Id get the whole thing and it would retrieve the value of that this week to do back.

16
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:19,180
So the pathway is typically used in our days as we develop more and more restful.

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,910
So it is the importance of pot where the balls increase is multifold.

18
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:29,020
Actually today when we talk about resources there would be multiple pathway tables in this team you

19
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,150
are aswell.

20
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,150
Now let's shift our attention to a moral attribute.

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,220
What are you seeing on the screen is one of the example implementations for a more terlet tribute to

22
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,520
this code which is typically pleasant inside your control.

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,970
So instead of spin control you have a method which is annotated with modal attribute and if you look

24
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:57,380
at the implementation in here what we are passing in is more as the argument and we are adding attributes

25
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,290
to the Mordred we are seeing more a lot at attribute options.

26
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,430
And I'm saying it is don't ask list and that list of options.

27
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,290
So where is the model to be used to disparage Hadad.

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,440
Rob don't some very years go into it.

29
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:17,960
In addition to add description and target date fields in here let's say there was a drop down where

30
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,560
I would want to show the list of values in the dropdown.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,020
So this list of values have remained this theme.

32
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,240
Right.

33
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:32,960
I don't want to populate them each time into the model for ADD to do abrade to do and all the other

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,580
requests which are coming in.

35
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,240
So if I have to do that individually in each of the control method then I would have to have all the

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,190
method calls and everything done in repeated places.

37
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,160
So instead of doing that what I can do is use a concept called modal attribute.

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:03:00,020
So once you define mortal attribute method in your controller this model attribute will be available

39
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,750
to all the methods in that control.

40
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,970
So in all the control the method whether you are doing an act to do whether you're doing a delete to

41
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:13,920
do update to do or whatever operation you are doing you would have that more attribute available.

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,850
And I can use that moral attribute to display the list of values in the drop down.

43
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,460
Here we are populating values of option one.

44
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:27,790
Option 2 an option to the model attribute indicate that the purpose of that method is to add one or

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:34,080
more modal attribute model attribute method is invoked before the request mapping method.

46
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,670
The dispatcher servlet looks at the uare from the browser and identifies the right control.

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,980
And before invoking it it would make sure that the model that butes populate it.

48
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,690
It is typically used to fill the model with commonly needed attribute like drop down values for a form.

49
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,580
The other kind of attribute are Sishen attributes.

50
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,000
You can add a notation called session attribute on your control.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,210
So here I am saying this is an attribute name.

52
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:10,790
This means that the immortal attribute name so whichever attribute displays in modal bit name of name

53
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:18,290
it would be stored inside sation as we discussed earlier when we talk about web applications for a specific

54
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,120
user.

55
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:25,880
There might be malicious people DP requests and to maintain the conditional state we use something called

56
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,970
session.

57
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,770
So whatever attributes whatever attributes that from the model you would want to store in decision you

58
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,330
can define and iteration called at session attributes.

59
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:44,690
Name For example when I'm using a web application when a user logs in I don't need to get his details

60
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,820
on the database every time I write his name is not going to change in 10 minutes that he spending with

61
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:56,540
the application or his details will not change for the most part so I can take them.

62
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:03,710
I can put them in the station and then I can reuse them across the your application this allows you

63
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,270
to do that.

64
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:11,420
So if you have used the details model attribute I can put it in decision by declaring an addition on

65
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:19,340
the control local decision attributes and the name of the model attribute an attribute list the name

66
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,210
of mortal attribute which should be transparently stored in the session or some conversational storage.

67
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,170
In this way do we looked at a couple of important concepts to be mortal attributes N.S. attribute.
