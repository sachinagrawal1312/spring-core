1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:09,730
Welcome back in this way you will start looking at the details of a request and the response we'll look

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:15,160
at examples of a quick withdrawal point and also what is stupider what kind of information to send in

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,950
this opener and also we look at an example of Thorpedo.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,570
So let's get started.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:27,200
As we discussed in the previous We do a super request contains a soap and inside the envelope is a header.

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:35,660
Here we have the Hadad and we have a board and you can see that the name space which is used here is

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,660
this top name space.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,800
So SOAP envelope.

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,110
This is the named place which we should use when we talk about soaps or schemas or similar but less

10
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,940
so.

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,490
So it's like us.

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,460
And so this is map which we are using in here.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,830
This open schema and what our specific thing get called Details requests.

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,560
We use a customized names so we call it how should we be in when did it not come.

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,840
Slash cortices.

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,330
So if you see all the things all the elements inside our request they use this too.

17
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,230
That's our namespace that's a custom namespace that we have created so that they will not be any collision

18
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:15,730
with.

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,520
Let's say there are of course other platforms which are offering different kinds of courses.

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,350
I don't want there to be one conflict with them.

21
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,880
So I use the namespace to differentiate my requests.

22
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,210
So and this too is here.

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,450
So in this to do industry everywhere in tade our request they'll be in a state which is used.

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,460
And you can see that the namespace for open loop is so open.

25
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:43,950
So for head or body all these things which are really related to the soup structure in lollop head a

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,730
body the soap and a piece that didn't in-space.

27
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,400
So this is an example so request.

28
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,780
Why isn't this request they get something called a soap press and I get the soap response has the name

29
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,850
spaces as well.

30
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:03,490
So you would have the soap and will up name space and also you have our customized space and you can

31
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:10,150
see that we are getting a detailed response back with the detail of the court record ID name description

32
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,130
and all that kind of stuff.

33
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,870
So this is a very simple example of soap request and soap response.

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,860
Next we'll look at something called Soap header.

35
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,420
In the previous video we said so Peddar and Bane's authentication information right.

36
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,470
So here we are using W-S.

37
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,100
See that one of the authentication implementations of WSEX security.

38
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:41,870
So security specifies the security for sope that so uses the standard through a security first approach.

39
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,200
So he says this is one of the implementations of that.

40
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,940
So we use WSC is the security.

41
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:54,720
So we specify the publicity namespace in here and in the header we send the user name and the password.

42
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,560
So here we are sending the user name and the password.

43
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:06,070
If we were using digest authentication then we would have been sending the digest instead of the password.

44
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:11,570
So in addition to the body of the request what we'll do is we'll also send the head.

45
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,590
So the header contains the security information of the request.

46
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,680
In this video we looked at examples of soap request response.

47
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:26,040
We also look at examples of soap request with a torpedo containing the authentication information until

48
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,050
an extremely boring.
