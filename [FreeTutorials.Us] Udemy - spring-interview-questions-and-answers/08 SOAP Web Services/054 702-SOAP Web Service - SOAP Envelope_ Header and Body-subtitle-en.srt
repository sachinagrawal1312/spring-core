1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:10,800
Well come back in that you will talk about soap is what does this open up to is what is soup or is this

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,310
open loop header and body.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,240
Let's get started now.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,700
So what is a sole purpose service.

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,270
Let's look at an example.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:25,880
So we have a two application which is offering services and they are accepting simple request and sending

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,070
back a simple example spawns.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,820
Is this a superb service.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,020
Does it become a soap.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:41,780
So it's actually not for something to be Earth soap so we examine because support it should be called

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,600
SOAP XML request and soap.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,090
Excellent response.

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,230
So it should be in a specific format called soap.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:57,200
When we talk about superbe services the most important thing is the format of the exchange.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,910
So how is the request question then how is the response and then what is the format what is the format

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,560
that is most important thing.

17
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,550
The format is soap.

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:12,470
Earlier soap used to stand for a simple object access protocol but it's no longer a simple object access

19
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,230
protocol.

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,530
So it's no longer an acronym.

21
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:24,140
It's kind of a simple name which represents this format so substantial for a format where you have soap

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:31,070
and when up when we talk about the soap request or a soap response it should meet these standard.

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:38,850
So you would have a soap and well up inside which there is an optional header and there is a board.

24
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:44,630
So this is kind of at the high level the structure of your request and the response so that you are

25
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,990
looking at a request or respond.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,520
They allow us open all up inside that you would have a soap header and so bored.

27
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,710
They had that typically contains information meta information like authentication or things like that

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,380
authentication authorization things like that and body would contain the real content of the request.

29
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:09,320
So let's say I want to get this place with court details then probably the body might contain get court

30
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,080
details.

31
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:16,070
But the court's idea is one if I'm getting to details probably the body would contain get to do the

32
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:24,220
deed and the idea of the to do I would want to retrieve the detail would most important thing is when

33
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:30,460
you call something a top but so is it should exchange the request and response in this specific format

34
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,720
as we discussed.

35
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,980
The format is Topix M-L request and supect similar response.

36
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,330
The thing about top is its transport independent.

37
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,250
Have you send the request so does not get about.

38
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,860
So when I call something superb services the transport can either be over the web that is Hashd DP or

39
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,980
it can be or were the MQ so it can.

40
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,830
The message might be even sent across using a queue.

41
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,180
So the way it might be is you might have two applications listening on the queue.

42
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,380
One is the producer.

43
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,420
The other is the consumer and the producer application would be listening on the queue for messages

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,730
when theres a new message in the queue.

45
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,130
It looks at it and consider to respond back on the queue.

46
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,440
That basically thought or what and where we are using it.

47
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:26,980
Q As the transport the other format is top overhead should it be when we are using web as a format when

48
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,920
we are offering soap services on the Internet on the web on the Internet whether we would want to offer

49
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,590
them.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,030
The other thing about top is the service definition has a strict format its called with Dell or do as

51
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,190
deal with Dell web service definition language.

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,650
We'll look at it in detail in the subsequent video in this we look at the following question So what

53
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,250
is this soap.

54
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:59,560
So is anything that added to the soap format and wollop header and body or is soap soap is no longer

55
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,140
an acronym.

56
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,400
It's just something which presents these kind of Apso.

57
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:10,220
And what is a soap and really it's kind of the encompassing thing for the Scoppetta.

58
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,810
And so what is so peda typically contains the authentication information.

59
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:20,230
And so a body contains the actual details of the request and the spot and then the next video by.
