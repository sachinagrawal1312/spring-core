00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,780
Welcome to the studio where we're going to talk about what is important and let's look at a sample example

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,880
and point it in with spinning Web services.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,430
So what is an end point.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:19,740
Or do web services do they accept request and tenderers want back that that's exactly what and putting

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,790
this end point accept a request and does all the business logic you'd need.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,070
Or it might not do all the business logic you'd need it would call another service to do all the business

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:39,380
logic and it would come with the rest boards back into the structure so that I can send to XM back toward

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,440
an end point.

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,110
Let's look at an example.

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:48,430
This is the process code details that request what we're doing in here is for a specific request ID

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,400
we want to get the details of the course and return them back.

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:01,070
If you look at the payload route it defined what kind of quest this end point can handle what we are

13
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:08,910
saying is any request with the namespace of this and the local for pipe as get cause details requests.

14
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:17,480
Then you can map it to this specific method and what we are also adding in is to get those details to

15
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,320
request.

16
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,730
So this is good cost diddles request is generated by Jacques's B.

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,590
This is the one which is present in here.

18
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:30,860
This is generated by Jacksboro get court details request and we take the request from the because we

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,000
take the ID and then we get the details.

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:45,010
Once we have the details of the court we would now map this code into the code details mapping structure.

21
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,510
What we are doing in the map call detail method is declaring an instance of the code detail.

22
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,430
This is the ex-inmate.

23
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,720
This is the one which is generated with DXP.

24
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,300
So we are creating an instance of that and taking the values from the quartz object and setting them

25
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,160
into the.

26
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,950
Details in the map code details method.

27
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,120
We are actually taking the values from a business object and setting it into the SML object.

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:15,480
So we are taking the values from our beans and setting them into the beans which are generated by be.

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,360
So these are all the Jacques's be things that we are setting us into so discours detail as we Lubet

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,520
live is the Jacques's beating this is generated by that people again that pre-configured earlier.

31
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:33,820
So in the end point what we are doing is actually taking that request or from the request we are taking

32
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,330
the details that are important.

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,530
We are calling this service to get all the details in the business objects from the business objects

34
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,400
we need to map it into the ex-MIL objects because we need to send the similar response so the map post

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,960
details maps that and we are returning that specific thing back and to make sure that the quest is mapped

36
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,130
properly.

37
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:04,870
We are using it in addition call request payload whatever data is part of this request really get mabbe

38
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:14,950
bound to this request and whatever details we are sending back will be the response payload the SML

39
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:22,480
will be bound to the Java object and the Java object would be converted to examine and the response

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,660
would be sent back.

41
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,560
Basically the end point is accepting an external input.

42
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,970
It cannot sit in Java takes it processes that take the response object convert it into ex-MIL and send

43
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:40,240
it back to the response great in this way we looked at it as an end point and we looked at an example

44
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,960
in point which was written using spinning web services and in the next video were.
