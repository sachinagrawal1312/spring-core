1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,930
In this way you will look at very important concept with being Web Services which is message dispatcher.

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,070
What is the message especially servlet and how do we can figure is better service.

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,770
When we talk about web applications we know about dispatch celebrate the spaceship's tablet acts as

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,870
the front controller.

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:26,240
It makes sure that all the requests first go to the dispatcher so late and then they would be distributed

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,550
out to the Carrack controllers.

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:35,060
When it comes to spring services message dispatch or service that does exactly the same thing.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:42,410
So what it does is the first request goes to message especially servlet and then it looks at the quest

9
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,840
it looks at the name space.

10
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:51,790
It looks at the request details and then mapped it to the appropriate and appointment.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,620
In the previous example reconfigured and in point M.Tech we said this is the method which should be

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,370
called when the local part is get called Details request.

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,550
So dispatcher established knows all this stuff so it knows that the name space.

14
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,710
This local by this maps to this method.

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:18,480
So when the dispatcher Sublette gets get calls vitis request it would map that request and called.

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,580
This is if we meant that how do we configure the method special so let it.

17
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,780
Very simple.

18
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,840
What we are looking at is the java configuration for that.

19
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,940
So the most important thing is the message the special service that is actually served.

20
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,710
So we need to first configure a serve lead for that.

21
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:43,480
So we need to do something QAL so late registration been inspiring if you would want to configure us

22
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:50,990
of let you would use a service registration been several registration been accepted to input most important

23
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:58,490
inputs that tablet registration been accept is disserve lit and also the you are right this is late

24
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,960
and this is the way we are mapping to that place to fix it and to configure the message itself.

25
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,530
All we need is an application context so we are taking the application context and we are setting it

26
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,260
as the application context or here.

27
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,940
And we are defining it as being we are defining this as the spring.

28
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,930
I mean this is basically a simple definition for message dispatch.

29
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:30,370
So we are saying all the requests which comes to W-S that need to be processed by the message dispatches.

30
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,210
In this video we took a quick look at message especially Sylhet and how you can configure it in a Java

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,080
configuration.
