1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,280
Welcome back in the previous steps we talked about the fact that when we use screengrab Sousa's we tried

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,500
the Xs and generator ideas deal out of it.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,520
So how do we configure generation of AWOS DL when we are using spring but services that's what we are

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,120
going to look at right now.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,930
One of the important things that we need to know is the fact that what is the input so the input generated

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,790
here is the schema right to disclose details that exist the schema.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,740
So the access to which we wrote and look that in the earlier examples.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,540
So this is the starting point for generating the BSD Doubler's deal will be generated using the access.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,130
DS So what we're defining is Access does Kema.

10
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,130
This is an buy into this is a spring been using a glass bottle of sorts.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,190
We are actually trying to look at because details are as they are not class but and using a simple Access

12
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,590
schema to define this specific things.

13
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:08,380
Now what we have this define we would want to now define the WC we'd be using the SDL 1.1.

14
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,930
So we're using default as the one one definition that the class which we are making use of.

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,490
You can see that one of the arguments which I posit is this is this.

16
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,250
That's basically what I would access the schema which we are defining in here.

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,980
And to be able to define a dabblings DL You need to define a pool type in the earlier video we looked

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,250
at what is a pool type put papers like an interface.

19
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:39,990
So we are defending code for sport as the pool type for it and also the name space is what we already

20
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,070
discussed.

21
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,800
Other than that we need to set v w d ill will be available so be warned of the WMD.

22
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,220
So we are saying this Doubler's deal should be available at slash W-S.

23
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,220
So what happens is when you launch up a sporting context the spring framework would look at this configuration

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,970
looks at the code schema and define a WS deal.

25
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,160
And you can see the damages exposed as we saw in the previous step in this quick review.

26
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,080
We looked at how to generate that GSD using webservices.
