1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,700
Back in this review we'll talk about WCM.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,440
What is his definition language and what are the different parts of the GST.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:18,540
This is D-W is the definition of words so we use this if you provide this W-S D-IL to any of the lines

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,100
of Web services they'd be able to know every detail of have to call you over.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,010
So these.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,460
So let's not dig in and see what are the different details that are present in the causes.

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,270
BSD.

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,390
So at the high level the important things that Apple isn't that types.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,500
You have a variety of messages.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:46,170
Then you have a type of binding and a Silvius and this is how most of the doublings deals would look

11
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,680
like.

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:54,300
This is kind of a common structure among all of these deals the DL types defines this stuff which is

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,340
present in this key.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,640
So if I look at the as DL types you you'd see the schema that we have created completely being present

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,430
in here.

16
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,610
We are defined the exact details in the request response request and respond.

17
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,000
So this is exactly what is present in W-S deal date.

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,900
This is exactly what we defined in our access to the index of the access is actually inside as the date

19
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,450
basically defines what the different structures to similar structures that we are going to use.

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,300
The next thing I would define the messages the messages are basically defining the requests and responses.

21
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,540
So what are the different requests and responses that will be that will be changed by the different

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,010
operations.

23
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,960
So we might have multiple operations.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,120
And what would be the request and what we did at this point.

25
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:53,430
So here we are saying okay this is the request and this is actually picking up from the element if I

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,890
get all calls details request which is defined in the types in the types we are defining the element

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,850
and here we are saying this is something which can be a request or response for one of the operation.

28
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,880
So both the requests and responses we will have messages defined.

29
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,560
So the important thing is here there's a complex staple called detail.

30
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,500
This cannot be used as a request or response element.

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,480
The only things which can be used as requests or response elements are what they are mapped as messages.

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,320
Once you have that request and response to messages defined you can actually map them to operations.

33
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,440
How do we do that.

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,640
We do that by using bolt type support type matches defines all the different operations.

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,290
So this particular of them so is pro-white these operations.

36
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,150
What are the options.

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,880
Get all Corddry to dance and get court details and in the operation map what does that request and what

38
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,890
is the response you're saying Forget all the details.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,070
The request is get of course the deal's request and the responses get all the details of this bond.

40
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:10,230
And similarly for the other one for the other one which is good because we did the request is get court

41
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,640
details request and the response is get good details as Bond.

42
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:23,430
What type is like an interface so you are defining OK this web server is all for these services if you

43
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,180
want to call this web service you would need to pass this input.

44
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,690
And this is the output.

45
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,640
So this is like the interface is different.

46
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,070
How do you call a specific method of right.

47
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:39,470
So that's exactly what is specified in the pool table type is the interface and the binding defines

48
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,620
the implementation.

49
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,050
How do you really call it.

50
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:49,040
So here the important thing is that we define our style and the transport the transport defines we're

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,500
using hash DTP hash UDP is Internet Web.

52
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,680
So the call to use call or happened or should he be so we are defining soap or what.

53
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,490
GTP.

54
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,320
So what we will be using is the other option obviously is soap or M.

55
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:12,120
Q When we are going to use q to transfer the requests and response style we are using here is document

56
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,810
to indicate the fact that we are actually exchanging complete Exham requests and similar response.

57
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:26,560
The alternate deal for document is actually something called RPE C which is the more procedure calls.

58
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,020
Its like calling a procedure which is defined somebody else.

59
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,090
It's like calling a a third which is present somewhere else when all the RTC we would need to define

60
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:44,520
the input parameters and we need to define the return type just like a third document is the most frequently

61
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,760
used style of so binding.

62
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,320
So here we are using a binding style of document and we are saying we are going to send the request

63
00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:01,130
over which DP We are indicating that these two operations are using this as binding.

64
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:08,580
So ending defines how are we going to expose our operations guessing we are going to expose them over

65
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:15,280
which deep deep the last one which is present in here is this is what is the location.

66
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,460
How are the clients going to use this.

67
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:17,960
So.

68
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:24,230
So you're saying super dress this is the address at which this is a high level that defines all different

69
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,100
elements may say just define what are the requests and the responses.

70
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,190
They defined the interface.

71
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,320
Basically what are the operations that are available binding maps the operations to how you are exposing

72
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,540
them whether using soap or HTP or soap or MQ and servies maps it to end point.

73
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:49,150
What is it you are a real bitch symbolist can use to call this web service.

74
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:55,700
These are the different details that are typically present in all the Dahlia's DNS and then the next

75
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,260
step bullae.
