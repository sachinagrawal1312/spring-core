00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,620
Welcome in this we do we would start discussing implementations of Atlas for their services with spring

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,940
rest and spring and ribbon we see in this video will focus on the GET request.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,030
So we would want to get the details of a specific sort using spring.

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,750
Just how do we do that.

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,150
What happens when we do or don't have been adequate mapping method and what is good mapping and related

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,870
material.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,680
But in spring at least let's get started now.

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:36,660
So what you are looking at on your screen is a simple gate mapping for Flash users.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,610
In the previous videos which were related to NBC we were talking about request mapping and we specified

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,420
Demetriades equal to the equipment that don't get good mapping is a shortcut to that to get mapping.

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,730
And that in addition where I'm saying OK I didn't want to say that eques mapping and then say the request

12
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,150
method is equal to this I would rather have a shortcut and say get mapping so good mapping is kind of

13
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,540
a shortcut to the quest Mapping Center to get mapping.

14
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,810
There are other things like force mapping mapping mapping and things like that.

15
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,900
This specific method handles a GET request to slash users and what is it doing it is talking to a service

16
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,320
retrieving all the details of the users and returning it back.

17
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:28,740
So this is a simple method for a gate is how does this get converted to J-Zone or whatever format of

18
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,620
your response that happens because of something call message converters video using springboard to Delap

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:35,970
here.

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:43,140
As for the services what happens is spinning boot registers message and where it is by default the default

21
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,280
message converter for J-Zone format is Jackson.

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,930
So what happens when I return a list of users is it will be converted to Jason and the J-Zone response

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,480
goes back in the shot.

24
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,310
We do we look that code for an example you get two thoughts with Pingris.

25
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,200
We looked at what happened when a business returned from a mapping method and we talked about good mapping

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,260
ports mapping and mapping and things like that until the next video.

27
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:12,620
Well Ray.
