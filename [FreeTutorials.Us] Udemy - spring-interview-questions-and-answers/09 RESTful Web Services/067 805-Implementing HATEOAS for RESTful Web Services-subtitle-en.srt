1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,740
This this way.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,530
Let's shift our attention to it.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,310
Hideous what is hideous.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,390
Can you give an example as opposed to hideous.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,180
How do you implement using spinning.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,080
Let's look at all these questions in this specific medium.

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:21,720
What is said to use videos is of Lijah expansion hypomania as the engine of applications.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,370
It is indeed a huge definition.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,280
Let's look at a simple example.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,980
So I'm going to my GET HELP page I'm looking at the list of repositories right now.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,330
So there's a Web page right in the web page.

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,510
What we're doing is I'm asking for my repositories.

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,760
So what is the page doing it reading me the details of all the repositories which are present in here

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:49,050
as being web services tips that are based templates and a lot of repositories about 34 of them.

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,670
Is just reading the data.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,190
It's also retaining the actions that I can perform same thing.

17
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,910
OK if you want to see more details about this being web services repository you can go here if you want

18
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:59,920
to start this.

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,970
You can do it here if you want to for this.

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,020
You can do it here.

21
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:09,130
So it's not just showing the data but also showing the actions you can pull from that data.

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:16,830
So you can start a repository and data repository or or repository or see the detail of a specific repository.

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,300
So it's not just retaining the data but also actions that you can perform on the data.

24
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:29,960
Hideous tries to bring that concept in restful prep so says when you ask for a source don't just return

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,720
the details of it so don't just do it then the data.

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,950
But also it is done.

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,820
What are the actions that can be performed.

28
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:43,490
What are the other things that can do more of this resource might be interested in.

29
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:50,940
For example let's take a Facebook for so let's say you are exposing service for fetching the details

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,880
of a Facebook post with Heti us what you would also consider returning.

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:02,240
Is it links to things like like how do you like the post.

32
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,880
How do you like the post.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,330
How do you comment on the post and things like that.

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,410
Here is an example.

35
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:17,590
So when we are requesting for a specific user what we are also sending in is the link to get all users.

36
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,780
This is a request to a specific user.

37
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:26,900
What we are sending is a link to all the users as well we are saying OK this is how you get the details

38
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,880
of our users.

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,430
How do we implement this kind of stuff in spring.

40
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:37,370
Theres a startup which is provided by spring board called Spring boot start ahead the.

41
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:48,150
So we need to do is we can include this data in and after that we can use a concept called source resource.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,890
You get to return not just the data so you will get to that and not just the user data.

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,150
So I can actually read the end user then the data goes out.

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,410
But what the source helps us to do is to build on top of that so I'm creating the results using the

45
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,970
user using the data.

46
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,610
So now the data is populated into the resource.

47
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,970
Once the data is populated you can add links.

48
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,200
So here I am trying to add a link.

49
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,840
What do I want to add.

50
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,630
I want to add links to all users.

51
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,730
So if you look at this this is how it would come out.

52
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:28,220
I would want to have a link with the reference as all users and I would want to have the link to which

53
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,430
the source I'd want to have the link to the tree.

54
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:41,300
All Users resort to the source which is pointed by the method retrieve all users easily hardcoded the

55
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,580
link in here I get say slash users and hide quoted in here.

56
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:51,110
But that would mean that any time I need to change the details you Aure or slash users I would need

57
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,150
to also change it in here rather than hard coding slash users directly here.

58
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:02,420
What we are saying is OK we would want to link to the resource which is exposed by this method by the

59
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:09,290
method and retrieve all users and we are returning the resource back when we implement it in this way.

60
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,940
You would get a response back as we look at it in this video we took a quick look at hate yours.

61
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:22,520
We will get an example response for videos and how we can implement it using something until next video.
