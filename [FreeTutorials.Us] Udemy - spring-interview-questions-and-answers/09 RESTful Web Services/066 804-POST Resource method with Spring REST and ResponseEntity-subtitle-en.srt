1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,290
This would you.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:09,860
Let's talk about the code for implementing a forced method both method is used to create resources so

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,490
I would want to create a resource.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,540
Also we'll look at why we use response entity in areas for.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,740
Let's look at an example implementation.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,500
So here I would want to create a user that I would want to create and you would use it.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,550
How do I create a new user.

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,890
We would send a POST request to slash users.

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,190
So what we are using is a forced mapping.

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:37,320
So we're using our annotation plus mapping and the uare slash users so this would handle the post was

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,480
to slash users.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,350
What we can think of the request is or whatever is part of the content of the requests that get mapped

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,920
to the user.

14
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,020
How do we do that.

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:54,560
We are doing that by using the at request body in addition to whatever is the post request content would

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,460
be mapped to this user.

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,950
So that's easy right.

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,490
I want to map the content to the user so that I can create the new user in here what we are doing is

19
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:09,630
we are actually using the service the state the user details to the database.

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,640
So we saved the user details to the database and it turned the saved user.

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:20,920
What is this piece of code doing this piece of code is ensuring that we are relating to the rest full

22
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,970
service best practices.

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,480
We know we created it.

24
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,000
We thought that we should send that as status off to all one here.

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,400
If I return this save the user back what would happen is this will directly return a status of success.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,760
It would send a status of success back.

27
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:47,420
But what we would want to do is we would want to send the status of created back as well as you'd want

28
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,760
to send the details of the created user.

29
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,090
What is the new resource that is created.

30
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,300
The neutralizer that is created is having ID off get ID.

31
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:06,230
So I would want to actually form the you wire of the new resource and send it back to the consumer so

32
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,270
that they can directly access that resource details.

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,850
How do I do that.

34
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,690
That is done by using responsa entity response entity.

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,960
You can say a status of created to I want to send a state as have created and here I am actually creating

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,280
the you Ira.

37
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:34,010
So I'm saying get to the current request uare at penned this pop to dispatch users Abend slash ID and

38
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:40,730
replace this template ID with whatever ID is coming back from the database.

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,830
So lets add this use I was saved with the database and he gets an ID of hundred.

40
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:53,210
So lets users slash hundred would be the uare which would be returned as part of the response header.

41
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,420
Let's look at a simple example of a so I would want to post.

42
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,380
So I chose post-master and I'm typing in a local host 88.

43
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,540
Less use.

44
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:09,530
And in the body and putting the content of what I would want to a name and birthdate and posting about

45
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,320
it in here.

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,200
And when you say in this what you would get back is a status of two hundred and one.

47
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,460
And indeed that is the work of didn't you created.

48
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,060
You said you can see the location in here it says location 88.

49
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,860
Slash uses slash.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,870
So that's basically what we have been discussing until now.

51
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:35,970
So whatever can we put in for the users part of the body is mapped in here at request body and we are

52
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,440
forming the location of the response you Ira that we would want to send as part of the location header

53
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,890
and we're adding a status of created.

54
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,530
So if you understand how it's being fired and what is the response that is coming back and what is the

55
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,810
header location header that is coming back.

56
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,560
It's very easy to directly look at this and relate to what is happening in here.

57
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:07,670
In this video we looked at how to create resource by using a force request using spinning wrist.

58
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:13,940
We also at why we need response and we need response entity in this specific example because we wanted

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,990
to return a status of created back.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,400
We didn't just want to Britton's taxes.

61
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:26,960
We want to return a specific status quo created the location of the created resource with the rest of

62
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,760
the created source.

63
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,130
And that's the reason why we used sponte indeed.

64
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,770
And then the next week you play.
