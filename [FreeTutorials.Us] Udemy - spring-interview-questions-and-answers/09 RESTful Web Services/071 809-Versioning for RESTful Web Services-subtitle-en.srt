1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,750
Come back in the studio let's discuss about the worsening for us.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,700
PHILLIPS So he says we'll discuss why do we need the training what are the options that are available

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,850
and how do we implement them for us for that.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,340
So he says let's get started now.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,920
Why do we need versioning.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:23,510
Let's say there was a first version of this service person with which was implemented just one field

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,270
for the entire name.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,160
This was good for the initial versions of this.

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:34,880
And after a couple of years we realized people would want actually to be able to store first name and

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,070
last name separately.

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:44,590
So we actually needed a second version of this service with the first name and last name upgrade.

12
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,940
I cannot have just one version of the service because the users of the first version of the service

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,000
will not be able to consume the second version because I'm changing the structure of the US bonds earlier

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,240
name was in a specific location.

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,480
But now I'm actually splitting it up into two fields.

16
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,870
First name and last name and the structure of the response changes.

17
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:11,950
So what is the first question of the server is will not be able to use the second version of the service.

18
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,670
So I would need to now definitely have two different and two of these services.

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,210
Now how do I handle scenarios like that.

20
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,250
What are the different versioning options that we have that what we would discuss now the first two

21
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,730
options of versioning are more related to you as you are right.

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,140
So what I can do is I can have Beaven and we do slash person.

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,710
So here we are using the you are right to separate the two.

24
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:44,270
Bush and the other option is to use request paramita questioning so you can pass devotion as a request

25
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,340
paramita question is equal to one and Bush is equal to two.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,390
Next option of versioning is called Haydar worsening in the header.

27
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,380
You would send a bad in the requested or you would tend to permit nothing except what I would want one

28
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,910
a separation.

29
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:08,070
I would want to the fourth option is to use a MIME type or accept header versioning here.

30
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:12,880
What we are doing is we are sending something called an accepte head.

31
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:22,310
So we expect the client to send and accept Hayder of this if they want to use the version 1 V-2 if they

32
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,640
want to use the wash.

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,130
So these are our before washing options.

34
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,290
One is by uare the next one is by request paramita.

35
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,420
The third one is the a header and the 12:56 is accepted.

36
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,140
Now how do we implement this.

37
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,330
Its very easy right.

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:43,520
So if I want to implement you or I were shining I can just say V-2 slash person and I would be able

39
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,750
to implement it here.

40
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,290
We want it to be as simple as that.

41
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:56,880
So now in here I am listening V-1 and here I am returning to the service know if I want to use reckless

42
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:04,010
paramita Wishnie then I will need to say Batum So this is how you can do this in spring NBC is a tribute

43
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,910
for the Get man thing called bantams you can the first version is equal to 1.

44
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,070
So this method is in-wall only if you get a request with paramita version of that you will one.

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,760
So similarly in your get mapping Batum is equal to wash and is equal to.

46
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,660
The other option is to use the header the references with headers interrupt padam.

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,100
I would want to say that.

48
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,600
So I'm saying that is equal to x A B version is equal to do.

49
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,470
Hey that's.

50
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,990
Except exit question is it.

51
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,250
So if you get ahead there is a question with a value to then this response is sent back.

52
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:43,520
There was this response to send back the other option is to use produce.

53
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:49,600
So here we are saying this method produces an output of this type in the request.

54
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,550
We put an accepted rule of this type.

55
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,930
Then we'll get this response.

56
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,400
Otherwise we'll get this response back.

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,970
This is also called MIME type or accepted a wish.

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,310
Let's look at invoking this right now.

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,690
So I'm trying to get requests to be one person.

60
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:10,070
You will see that it's getting Charlie back pop chali name is one and we do.

61
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,210
It gives me the split first name and last name.

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,770
The other option that we talk about is by using a paramita.

63
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,240
So here we are using a paramita question is equal to 1.

64
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,700
And here Washington is tickled to hear you get devotion to the request.

65
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,900
The other option is to use the header.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,560
Right so we talked about the header option header.

67
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,600
I'm sending a header back header.

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,530
What's the header that we want to use X API.

69
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,190
So I'll copy this here.

70
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,110
Except you word shown except the question is one will get the version one.

71
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,210
Except the question is to get wash to do so.

72
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:56,420
And the other option which will do that is to use the producers that the mime type produces.

73
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,770
I don't need this code but I would need accepted it.

74
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:06,070
I'm saying I would accept a response of type which is present in here.

75
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,410
So I'm copying this in executing.

76
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:16,760
So now I'm getting one of the response I'm getting to have the response right now.

77
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,910
So what look at is the four different options.

78
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:25,790
These are four of the different options that are present to wash us for the services what you are looking

79
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:33,000
at on the screen is some of the big organizations where each of these versions are being made use of.

80
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,260
You can see that immediate I versioning This is the accepted or worst thing is use it.

81
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:44,710
Good Hope washing is use at Microsoft you are wishing is using Twitter experimentor which is used in

82
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:53,180
isn't actually the thing is all these four methods of worshipping all these for IDs of washing your

83
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,800
abs have their advantages and disadvantages.

84
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,540
So you have to evaluate them for us.

85
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:05,000
We can because there are a lot of factors that you need to consider before deciding your washing approach

86
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,930
things like you are a pollution misuse of SATB headers because the options 3 and 4 that we discussed

87
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,020
using the HDD behaviors tend to misuse the history.

88
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,340
DP It is because the behaviors were not meant to be used to watch when you were a POS.

89
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,590
You should also think about caching if you are distinguishing US-Soviet versions based on his UDP headers.

90
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,660
It might be difficult to cache them.

91
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,760
The other factor which you need to consider is the kind of consumers you would have if you have a lot

92
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,610
of non-technical consumers who are executing requests on the browser then probably should go with the

93
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:47,060
simpler option of not using D.H. should be hated and the last important factor you need to consider

94
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,680
is also API documentation.

95
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,500
So how are you generating the documentation and how do you want to include versioning entire API documentation.

96
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,000
The summary is that there is no perfect solution.

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,480
You have to really evaluate the washing options based on your needs and make the right choice for you

98
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,010
until the next real way.
