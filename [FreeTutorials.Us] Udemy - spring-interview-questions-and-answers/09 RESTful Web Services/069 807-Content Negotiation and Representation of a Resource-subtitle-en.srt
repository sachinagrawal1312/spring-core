1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,870
Welcome back in this we will talk about presentation of what we saw.

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,350
The rest is all about resources and good representations.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,220
What is representational for this sort.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,040
What is a negotiation.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,370
What is the history behind it which is used for negotiation.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,960
How do we implement content negotiation using string boot and also how do you add support for example

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,540
in you address for Web services.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,180
Typically this provides services use this on format but if you want to use Excel for Mac How do you

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,080
do that.

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:39,900
OK lots of questions but actually the answer for all of these is are very much related to what we are

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,790
going to do now.

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,530
Let's go to our favorite U.K. postman and fired a couple of requests.

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:54,130
I'm fighting a GET request to local host ADHD slash users and clicking send and getting the details

14
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:54,790
of users.

15
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:01,540
What is the format in which I'm getting the response back I'm getting it in the format of J-Zone right.

16
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,920
This is just on format.

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:10,480
So how did we decide on actually Menudo up something with springboard.

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,550
It's the default.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,580
So when you have the press will be upset with this spring but the default message converter which is

20
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,310
used is just on Jackson.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,430
Let's say I would want to have XM respond back instead of Jason.

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:34,290
How do I tell that to the Szilard typically HTP has this thing called accepted or accepted it else.

23
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,920
I'm saying that it was way too.

24
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:43,780
I'm saying I would want a similar response back so the way I can specify it basing application slash

25
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,830
exam.

26
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,650
That's the response I would go on to get back.

27
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:56,380
Now I click the send now I'm getting a response back in XM and now if I say it is on what form does

28
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:05,890
it come back it comes back in just on when I'm saying in it's coming back in a similar format.

29
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:13,340
The great thing is not just this but you can also send post requests using ex-model format.

30
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:21,300
I can't say I can take this and actually send a post request as well so not just this but I can send

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,620
a post request.

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,150
The body content is application Semmel.

33
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,930
And Adam is already there.

34
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,580
I don't need to send an ID so I'll save it for Adam Adam too.

35
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:42,130
And file this request you'd see that you get a response back of two or one created.

36
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,820
And when I send DID IT GET request to this.

37
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,820
You can see that at the bottom of the screen there is Adam 2 who is added in what we have been doing

38
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:58,280
until now is instead of using Jason as the format we were using application except mid-last the format.

39
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:04,600
So when you were sending a request we were sending it and accept Hayder call application exam and then

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,780
we were sending a post request what we would be sending is a header called content type.

41
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:17,050
We are saying the Content-Type I'm sending in this application ex-inmate this thing which we are doing

42
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:25,980
is called content negotiation what we're sending to the server is that I would want a similar response.

43
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:31,050
I would want just one response was telling that the client is telling that to do so.

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:37,750
The awesome thing is their server is able to understand that and be able to send their response in the

45
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,730
appropriate format.

46
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,900
Now let's go back to the set of questions that we had.

47
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,240
So what is the representation of the source.

48
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,870
When we talk about users use this is the same.

49
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,510
The resource is the users.

50
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:58,150
What we are seeing in the responses is the presentation of the resource the similar presentation of

51
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,870
the desert or just on the presentation of the text.

52
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:09,910
So the representation is basically the format you are using to represent your resource What is content

53
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,230
negotiation.

54
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,820
In the earlier example we saw that when we sent this I was responding back with similar response when

55
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,410
we sent Jason as the accepted her.

56
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:28,930
So what was responding back with Jason and that is basically what is called in negotiation is a negotiation

57
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,780
which happens between the server and declined declined saying I want it in this format.

58
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,290
And so we're sending the response back in that specific format that is Campton negotiation which he

59
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,320
hit his head.

60
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,840
Was put into negotiation.

61
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,010
Typically when I'm sending a request I would use accepte head.

62
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,360
So the accepted Spaceways can then type that I would expect for the response.

63
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,440
How do we implemented with using spring boot and how do you adek Semmel support both of them have the

64
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,680
same answer it.

65
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,590
It's very simple to add ex-MIL support to your recipe webservices which are built using spring build

66
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:13,360
all that you need to add is a simple dependency Jackson data format a simple one to add this example

67
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:21,100
in springboard would automatically configure the X M-L misstates can word that in this way we focus

68
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,680
on content negotiation.

69
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,620
We talked about representation of the source.

70
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,100
What is the history behind that which is used for content negotiation and how can we implement ex-MIL

71
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,290
support for us for that.

72
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,200
So is this using spring and didn't actually go away.
