1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:02,820
This would you.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,660
Let's shift our attention to what.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,870
Documenting this for Web services.

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,280
How do we document that.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,360
So is this what is the Raguel.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:17,110
How can we generate back up for restfully web services and also how to add custom information using

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,870
swagga documentation.

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,600
We like to look at what is dragged away.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,860
Let's get started now.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,440
There are multiple ways you can document your restful Web services.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,670
There is Rabil there is open talks and the one which is popular right now is what is called Swagger.

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,120
Swagger is now called the open API specification.

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,750
The specification helps us to define the contract for rest for Web services.

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,710
You can define what are the.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,770
What are the operations that can be performed before we look at the details of this swaggerer documentation

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,530
and the specific format of it.

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,090
What we do is we look at how degenerated from our code.

18
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:03,100
So if you have a restful web service which is built using springboard then you need to do is to add

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,010
these two dependencies in.

20
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:10,780
So you need to add a dependency calls bring Fox ragged to and spring Fox back to you.

21
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,280
I will look at the way first but I get a little later.

22
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,510
These are the things that you need to be able to generate documentation for your full web services.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,680
Once you add in the dependency you can configure a simple swagga config.

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,260
Here we are actually enabling this documentation for this project and we think this is a spin configuration.

25
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,600
And other than that we need to create a simple been called a docket.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,470
And we're using Swagel to wash in of the specification.

27
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:44,470
So you're saying we would want to expose Swagel was not the specification for all of this yes and once

28
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:50,860
you do this you'd be able to see swaggerer documentation for us so users in this format will understand

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,180
what in artist go through.

30
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,680
When we look at the high level these are the important elements which represent in as good documentation.

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,070
You think you're using swagga 2.0.

32
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,660
That's the question of the specification we're using the input bag contains the high level information

33
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,430
about our EPA what kind of EPA up your footing and that kind of stuff.

34
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:19,090
And the host is where we are hosting the service or we are hosting the EPA.

35
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,430
The best part is the base.

36
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:27,360
But if the base part is slash EPA then to call the services you need to use close the ADT slash.

37
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:35,030
And that's something which you can use to group your resources so for each of your resources and resource

38
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:43,390
methods you can same bags and bags can be used to group your resources into multiple categories or things

39
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:51,040
like that but include the details of all the resources that we are exposing and the different operations

40
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:59,740
that can be performed on each of these thought this definitions include the different elements that

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,280
are used in our EPA for example.

42
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,070
What does the user contain what are the different elements inside the user.

43
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,990
What are the different elements inside the hello world.

44
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,230
That's what is provided by the definition.

45
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:20,650
It's very important that we need to dig in for parts and definitions.

46
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,880
Let's do that right now.

47
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,480
So what is info contained in detail it contains a description of your API.

48
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:33,530
So here I can see this is my awesome EPA and a high level overview of what kind of things that we are

49
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,730
doing probably here we can say something like we are exposing the EPA for a social media application

50
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,370
and high level information.

51
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,150
And that wasn't the situation of the EPA.

52
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,700
You're exposing in here you can do it title.

53
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,590
And if there are any terms of services that you have you can put it in here and you can have a contact

54
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,560
person you can put the details in here as well as the license.

55
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,150
So the default license which is present in here is Apache 2.0 that you're in for attack.

56
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,230
The most important ones are inside the box contain all the resources that we are exposing.

57
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,590
We created a lot of hello world resources.

58
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:19,780
Those are here other than that the most important ones are the user resources so we have resort to exposing

59
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,630
all the users.

60
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:25,410
And also we have a specific user to do so as well.

61
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,510
So this one the user flash IDs a specific user.

62
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,960
So you were trying to get the details or delete a specific user.

63
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:38,710
And here this is group of users this really sort of exposes a group of users for a specific user.

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,640
Let's begin the users folder.

65
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,160
When I go inside you would see that there are two operations which can be performed what are the options

66
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:53,650
get and post so you can get the details of all users or you can use the post-operation to create a new

67
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,410
user.

68
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,790
What should we doing to get the operation into get operation.

69
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:04,470
You can see there's a summary and operation Id We think we can do an application design and produce

70
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,480
our daughter in the next step.

71
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,630
We look at how to customize this actually we can consume both applications as well as application X-Men

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,360
and we can produce applications.

73
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:20,130
So nice to see priggishness sentiment and also what are the different responses that we can give so

74
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:26,070
you can see that we can provide a responsive 200 when it's success when we would say 3:56 when it's

75
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:31,990
not found when there is a user ID password or when authentication details are not really provided.

76
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,970
What do you do.

77
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,840
Send a photo.

78
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:41,370
One thing you are an interface to access this is when we look at the success so the 200 there is a schema

79
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:48,570
definition which is pleasant in here we think we will find in every area of what area of use.

80
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,430
Thats the thing which is returning back what we are defending in here is the Spawn's would contain an

81
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,370
array of users.

82
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,670
Where is the user present the user is present in definitions.

83
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,760
I can go to the definitions here and click that and you'd see that user is defined in here I can click

84
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,780
user for folder and see the complete definition for user id seen.

85
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:20,710
But the date string date then Id integer and a name so user content these properties at a high level.

86
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,340
But define what are the two sources that are exposed for each of the resources you see.

87
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:34,080
What are the different operations that are allowed and for each operation we would see what it consumes

88
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,280
what it produces.

89
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,000
And what are the different responses that are present.

90
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,920
In addition for possed requests you will also have Bajrami.

91
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,890
We have.

92
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:51,360
I mean how was it sent it sent as part of the board to your daily quest for the post request for Flash

93
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,830
users accept the input of pipe users inside the body of the request.

94
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,730
And also we are saying it's required because without that there is no use to send a request.

95
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,090
If you don't send the user the data.

96
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,100
What is the use of signing up for request.

97
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,920
The other resource which is X-post is best if you use it right.

98
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,490
Let's use that slash ID on this.

99
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
What are the operations that we are following.

100
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,360
We are having as of now or get an A.

101
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,800
Let's look at delete you'd see that the country owns produces almost the same.

102
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,280
What we are saying there is a bad meter.

103
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,830
There is one parameter.

104
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:33,230
Its called ID of type integer but its sent in the bar.

105
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,110
We are differentiating it here.

106
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,860
So here we are accepting it in the pot.

107
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:46,140
However in the fourth request How should the details be sent inside the board in Sabbat ammeters in

108
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,050
body imports requests what do we do.

109
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,660
We put the content as part of the body of the request and in the delete and to get the space recusant

110
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,100
where do we put the ID.

111
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,370
ID is inside the box.

112
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,960
So parts of Defense resources the different operations and the details of each operation and definitions

113
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,960
define what are the different kinds of objects that are being used.

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,870
These definitions are used in the different operations exposed by each of the sort.

115
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:24,980
When we are doing a great operation on this last year we would return back a list of to this resource

116
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:32,970
of users is what we are sending back on the Get operation on a specific user or here.

117
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,200
You're saying it's sort of you use it.

118
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,800
What is the difference between user and resource user.

119
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:45,630
The resource that contains additional links to be defined hit earthlings to Haiti or Serling's.

120
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:45,930
Right.

121
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:51,420
So those links are added in in the resource of the user type.

122
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,210
So it contains link and definition of the link is also present in here.

123
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,890
As we discussed earlier Ligon campaigns are real and hedged.

124
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:07,390
If so Drell is all hype and users and hitched up is the actual link to that particular resource.

125
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,560
When you want to expose the swaggerer documentation to your client there are two ways you can actually

126
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,060
download this as a surrogate or just on and send it out to your client.

127
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,940
Or you can use something called swagga.

128
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:28,740
Q So I'm going to do you at a local host Aidy this baggage you've got the mail and press enter and then

129
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:36,420
this is why for all the operations that are being exposed so I can click use a resource here to expand

130
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,630
operations in here.

131
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:43,160
You can see the different resources and operations that are present so we can see that the user return

132
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:49,390
is exposing get less users less users delete a specific user and get a specific user.

133
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:55,200
And if you do want to see the details of those you can click it and you can see what is the response

134
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,830
and what is the schema for the response.

135
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,520
And you can also see what the different response code that you can expect taking a step back.

136
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:13,980
So I would want to share my documentation my documentation my documentation with my consumer so I can

137
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:22,480
go and save this Jason or I can see and share this with my customers or I can share the link to my swag.

138
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,570
To either of these will not be a bad idea.

139
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,500
One of the things which we can also do is we can consolidate the details of all the resources which

140
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,950
are split into multiple locations which are exposing resources we can actually have one place where

141
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:44,550
all the documentation is consolidated and exposed to using the swagga way the documentation that we

142
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,620
can read for those sources.

143
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,240
Very important because this is what our consumers will look at.

144
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,320
If you look at the documentation right now it's not really perfect.

145
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:01,260
We'll try and improve it a little more so that the customers all the consumers of this of these would

146
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,460
be able to understand the service much better.

147
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:10,050
So let's say I would want to say the default contact is so and so so the contact information for the

148
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,010
API is to enter.

149
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:19,320
So I can define a default on taxing them in 28 minutes and my email ID and also I can say the default

150
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,820
EPA in four as well.

151
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,880
I can't say how I would want to actually use AP.

152
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,810
Awesome EPA title awesome EPA description and I can define what is the license which needs to be used

153
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,940
for these abs.

154
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,860
And also I would want to configure the default producers and consumers producers and consumers a little

155
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,300
later as well.

156
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,030
So for now it were going to produce an bazooms to application just on application examine what we can

157
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:51,180
do is we can use this in the dark to earlier we just defined a simple Dockett But now we are extending

158
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,300
it we are saying OK I would want to use this API in full.

159
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,430
I'd want to use this.

160
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:04,470
Producers were just present in here and I would want to use the consumes altar as the default producers

161
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,580
and consumers from here.

162
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:12,420
So we are extending the docket both customizing the information which we would want to show if you refresh

163
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,760
the paradox now you would see whatever customisation we have done sure will show up in the description

164
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:24,480
to May a description or so maybe it did the contact details and the license as well.

165
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,370
If you go a little below you would be able to see consumers and producers in the formats that we have

166
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,370
specified in a cord.

167
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,730
So anti-law will be a couple of things right.

168
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,180
We just needed to add it added dependency couple of dependencies and then we need to configure swagga

169
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,140
config.

170
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:46,800
This would give us the basic documentation and if you wanted to customize it to our needs to our specific

171
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,400
needs then we can use things like this to customize the docket.

172
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:57,560
Swagger also offers a lot of annotations to add details about your model.

173
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:05,160
But if you want things like validations to appear in the documentation then you can customize the messages

174
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,120
for that.

175
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,920
Here we are adding a moral property saying name should have at least two characters.

176
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:17,480
So what we have in here would also appear in this record documentation.

177
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:24,720
You see here that for user there is a description saying name should at least name should have at least

178
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,000
2 characters for the rest of the stuff.

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,490
There is no documentation and search for name.

180
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,590
There is a description the name should have at least two characters one of the important things that

181
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,320
we would need to think about when you are talking about this.

182
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,850
So have your consumers would be thinking about your documentation.

183
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,700
So if you just put name they don't know what is the validation message on the name.

184
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,940
They should know what is it they should have details of the different relation which is which represent

185
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,400
those kind of stuff.

186
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,690
You can add in using your at API model property in addition.
