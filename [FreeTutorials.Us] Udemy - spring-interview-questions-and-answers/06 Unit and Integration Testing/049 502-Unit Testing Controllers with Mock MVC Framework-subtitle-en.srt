1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,460
Welcome back in this way you look at some of the important concepts you would need to use when writing

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,740
unit tests for the Babli.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,320
So in the way of spelling we make use of spring NBC or whatever is called the spring rest frame work.

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:26,220
So in this space we video will take one of the controllers that is present and look at how to write

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,660
unit tests for it using the mock NBC framework.

6
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:38,630
We look at annotations like an NBC test at Moblin and we will also look at how to use on assert to so

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,870
that is.

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,350
This looks like a very very simple method that we would want at this rate.

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,380
There is a pathway you will call it that way the pathway will call question id and we are calling a

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,130
service is to retrieve the details of the survey and we are returning it back.

11
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,390
So this is a typical press release method right.

12
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,310
So it gets the details.

13
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,520
What happens is it is done.

14
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,650
The liftoff.

15
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:12,500
So question back the framework then convert it into J-Zone and returning back to what we get as the

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,460
output for this.

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,010
So this is just on.

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,150
So how do we drive a unit test for this writing unit.

19
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,880
This probably is a really complex thing.

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,130
So just for a couple of lines of code in here actually we would write a much much bigger unit test.

21
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,120
How do we do that.

22
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,960
We'll start with the set up.

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,410
So the first thing we would want to talk about is the at NBC.

24
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:45,410
So we would want to write a test for which controller this basic method is in a controller called so

25
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,300
we can roll.

26
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:52,530
So I'm saying I wouldn't write a verb NBC test for weight control not us.

27
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,960
And I'm saying they should run them.

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,340
We will want to create a spring application context and that's the reason why we say we will use Spring

29
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,200
Run metal door glass and we are all the wiring the mock NBC.

30
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:16,220
So once we Ryden web MBC test we can artwork we'll have something called a mock MVC which is available

31
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,910
we can fire our requests against it.

32
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:26,700
So what we would want to replicate doing is just like we type you are raised in the browser.

33
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,630
So on the browser I would have to invoke.

34
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,250
So is the way I would need to call it a local host call an ADHD slash survey slash survey ID.

35
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,200
Last question.

36
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,330
Last question.

37
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,520
So I would want to be able to execute the same you aren't in the unit test.

38
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,630
I can use mawk NBC to exit qued that and also I don't really want to tie up with the deals with the.

39
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,890
I would want to mark this out the Moblin annotation allows me to mark these thing.

40
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,130
So I would want to mark the was out and return data that I would want.

41
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,800
Here we are trying to retrieve just one question so we are saying it is start to retrieve specific question

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,880
2 will only get one question back.

43
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,870
So I would want to mark this so it is not a trick question to written one question back and then I would

44
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:26,240
want to fire the request on mock NBC and check that the result contained Jaison as expected.

45
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,150
Let's see the details of the test.

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,450
So we are creating a mock.

47
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,050
Question.

48
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:37,250
So with a few details and we are saying when so we are resorting to the question is called then return

49
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,820
this more question back to what we are saying is whenever this servicer is right to question method

50
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:50,720
is going to turn the question and then what we are doing is we are actually building the content of

51
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,000
the request that we would want to send.

52
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:59,430
We would want to send a request to this hourly rates were slashed so one last question one and we are

53
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,350
also setting an accept type.

54
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,560
So what kind of response do we want.

55
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,120
We would want a J-Zone response so I am setting that as well in here.

56
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,420
So I'm building the request builder in here.

57
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,950
And after that I'm executing the requests I'm saying Mark and we see that performed request builder

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,250
and return and this will return the result.

59
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,610
So what I'm doing is I'm setting up the mark and then calling the request.

60
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:31,730
So I'm making the request using mark and B C and then I'm checking whether the expected response is.

61
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:39,200
So I would expect a response which contains ideas question description is largest country in the world.

62
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,960
And correct answer is Russia that's based on the object which is pleasant in here.

63
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:52,910
So I'm expecting the same question in Dasen format as the output for this specific result.

64
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,430
What I'm doing is from the result I'm getting the response and converting it into worse treeing and

65
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,480
checking that these two match.

66
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:07,610
Whether this expected matches with the content as being in here one of the important things is we are

67
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:14,170
making use of the J-Zone as a framework to say that these are equal when we compare these two adjacent.

68
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,520
They might be small space differences and also there might be some fields which might be missing.

69
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,380
So just an asset will be easily able to as sold irrespective of those differences.

70
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:32,710
So if I say just an asset and just pass in the field then it will just check for the ID field and so

71
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,170
on.

72
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,170
If I send ID and description then it takes both for the ID and the description and if I send the country

73
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,290
the correct answer it will check for all these three.

74
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:49,700
So it will check whether these three values have the these three fields have the correct values inside

75
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,700
the dates on the spot.

76
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:58,380
We are getting back just an answer it is a very useful framework to assert its own values.

77
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:05,570
So even if there is an extra space right here or if theres an extra space after description and those

78
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,650
are not really important things synergies and you would want to ignore them all those kind of things.

79
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:17,300
Gibson is they will be able to easily know and it will only set for things which I specify in here.

80
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,790
So if I'm only specifying a couple of closely checked the values of those attributes inside that is

81
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,510
not just an asset it makes searching just aren't very easy in this small video.

82
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:38,370
We looked at how to use Mark MVC test to unit test MVC meant that we Lubet What is the use of at MVC

83
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,550
test and addition.

84
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:46,140
We saw that its foot in here and we specified which we wanted to unit test.

85
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:53,160
We also looked at what is a mob been used more been in addition to create a mock of the subway service

86
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,100
we looked at all the steps in writing a unit test with mock NBC News just on assert to assert that the

87
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,170
sun is as expected.

88
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:06,990
This might be a little complex if you have not done a unit test with Mark and C before these are the

89
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,570
important things that you would need to know about writing unit tests using Marcom easy until the next

90
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:12,960
video.

91
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,460
OK.
