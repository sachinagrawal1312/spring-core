1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,550
WELCOME BACK IN THIS WOULD YOU would want to focus on what's the difference between controller and component

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,440
at repository at ease.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,940
And these kind of annotations in the spring we already used that company in Ottawa and editions right.

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,870
What does that component signify.

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,670
It signifies the fact that something is a bean that needs to be managed by spring.

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,410
If I put that component on something then I'm telling.

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:25,820
OK.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,480
When you are in control of this bin you create this being you would fire the dependencies in you take

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,510
care of destroying the been at a later point in time as well.

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,080
So that's what that company Insigne face right.

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:41,910
And the word is all about finding the matching being on a dependency over that water wired.

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,630
And what do you expect sprint to do.

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,860
You would expect to find a matching dependency and or to wire it in.

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,230
These are things which we have been discussing a lot in the business with us as well.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,440
Now let's come into the most important part of this do.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,580
That's the difference between a component repository at servies and controller at the high level when

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,960
we look at component components the most in reconstruction.

18
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,650
What direct deposit rate is in that controller.

19
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,290
Let's look at it in detail.

20
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,190
When we talk about web applications we talk about multiple layers right.

21
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,490
You have a badly or you have a business layer and a detail.

22
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,140
You can use that component on any of the components in any of these.

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,870
So it's really generic.

24
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:32,890
However when it comes to the other ones at controller for example it's typically used in the babbly

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,280
or at comptroller's signifies something which is using the MVC pattern model.

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,250
You can pull apart.

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,700
And that in the bably or at repository on the other hand specify something on the data that you would

28
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,070
use at repository typically on things like a DA or Data Access object.

29
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,260
So these are the things which are really related to getting the data from your database whether it's

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,900
relational database or whether it's a big data data stored.

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,910
It doesn't really matter.

32
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:07,930
So whatever data stored you're talking to you would use that repository on top of it.

33
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:14,240
The last one we use is typically used in the business layered in your business logic.

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,400
The most important functional that you would want to provide is transaction management or you are farside

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:26,120
objects which are present in the business layer you would use at servies There is also a little bit

36
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:31,730
of meaning which is attached to these annotations by spring and work as well.

37
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:39,320
So when you tag any component with any repository spring would automatically add the exception translation

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,600
for J.D. B.C exceptions.

39
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:48,680
So whenever a JBC exception happens then it needs to be translated into the specifics pring exception.

40
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,490
So if you put a repository on top of any component then that happens automatically.

41
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,800
And we look at controller a lot more.

42
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,990
When we talk about the MVC What does it signify what is the output What's the input and controller and

43
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,150
things like that.

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,540
In summary at component is the most generic one and a repository.

45
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,240
So we as a controller are supposed to be used in it specifically.

46
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:20,690
It kind of provides an additional way you can classify your components and identified them if you want

47
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,280
to add any specific functionality for that specifically.

48
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:31,310
So if you want to let's say log all the input and output that are going from your data access method

49
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:38,940
then you can look at any repository as a way to identify your beans and weave your EPA around them in

50
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,380
3D.

51
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,660
We looked at at component at Waterworld and we also looked at the differences between controller at

52
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,100
component and repository and at civies and additions and then the next video.
