00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:08,800
Before we end this section on spring we would want to discuss a high level question about putting framework

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:09,610
in this tweet.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,950
Typically ask questions like What do you think about putting Priem book why it's being popular or can

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,780
you give a big picture overview of the spring frame.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,720
How do you go about answering that.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,270
That's basically what we will discuss in this medium.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,610
When we talk about spring in Book I would really look at it from three different perspectives right

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,690
architecture design and your programming or coding.

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,300
And other than that we can also talk about the different features ofspring framework different sping

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,000
models which are present and also about the different spring projects which are present.

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,040
These are all important things that we would need to cower when we are asking any questions related

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,230
to any of this stuff you are seeing on the screen right now you can choose any of those things which

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,020
you are really comfortable with.

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,000
For example when I talk about architecture one of the important things that beings have put is very

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,730
very flexible architectures.

16
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,700
Earlier we looked at multiple layers in a web application.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,030
Right.

18
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,440
So the lab layer that earlier as well as your business lead.

19
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,870
Let's dig deep web layer for example.

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,280
Spring has good support for scraps as well as spring has its own NBC frameup the fact that I'm using

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,240
spring does not restrict the choice I have with the Web at NBC so I can still use traps or I can use

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,360
sping NBC or I can use any other thing.

23
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,300
For example if I want to use JCP for views sping has good support for it if they want.

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,480
Because free market for use even then Bing has good support for it.

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,480
For example if I want to use Aspect Oriented Programming then springs supports basic aspirator into

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,780
programming by itself.

27
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:56,870
But it also has good integration with Aspect Oriented Programming framework like aspected.

28
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,860
So that's very important when we're talking about something from an architectural perspective.

29
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:08,640
I want to have the flexibility using the Spring Framework should not reduce the amount of choices I

30
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,720
have to develop my application.

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,410
That's one of the most important features of Spring Framework.

32
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,210
It does not really restrict any of your choices when I am making use of the spinning framework next

33
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,890
from the perspective design.

34
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,830
We already talked about by coupling loose coupling house being promoted.

35
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,020
Applications do have good loosely coupled design.

36
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,840
So because of the loosley couple design you would see that code would be very easy to use.

37
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,620
So whenever I would want to write a unit test because we have designed the application in a loosely

38
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,320
coupled with with all the dependencies demarcated really well you'd see that when I develop an application

39
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,730
mid-spring it's very easy to unit test it.

40
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,480
What are we talking about popularity of spring Primack.

41
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,130
I think these are the most important reasons.

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,960
I mean very very flexible in terms of the architecture helps in designing loosley couple applications

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,500
which can be easily unit tested different features offspring which enable these features are dependency

44
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,710
injection I use the containers we all already dogbone out our wiring and components.

45
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,950
And the other thing you can talk about when such questions are asked.

46
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,650
Talk about being modeled.

47
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,710
What are the different models you have with things like that and also talk about the different spring

48
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,800
projects that you have with in this video.

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,780
We took a quick look at how to answer questions related to Big picture with respect to spring frame

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,880
but things like what do you think about it or why is it popular.

51
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,680
Can you give a big picture of this playing framework and things like that until the next video.
