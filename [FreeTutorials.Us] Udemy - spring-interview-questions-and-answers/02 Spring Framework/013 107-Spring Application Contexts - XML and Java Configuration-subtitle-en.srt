1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,720
This would you would want to look at the different options which are present for spring application

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:12,020
context from an NGO and how do you choose between them in a way we have actually discussed this in one

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,670
of the earlier videos as well.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,830
So this might be a little bit of repetition but the important thing we would also want to discuss is

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,960
how do you choose between similar configurations.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,140
Also we think this is an important concept so let's discuss it one more time.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,100
Let's look at the example of configuring your application contex right to.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:39,350
As we look earlier to define the ex-American text with all your being and so in here you'll find all

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,200
your beans between your beans and beans.

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:47,180
You define all the beans that you would want to define and you can launch it using class public example

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:54,350
application context so in your main method you can do this and it would try and find this business application

12
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:00,500
context direct XML and other A or text in the entire class part of your job application.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,560
The job of creating a spin context is also very simple.

14
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:09,560
You just need to put the configuration on your configuration being you can use beans to define all the

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,590
configuration which is present in here and you can launch it up using an addition configured obligacion

16
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:21,200
context or that you need to do is send the class name that class.

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,930
So these are the two with a Java and X-amount Which one do you prefer.

18
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:33,440
Actually with things like auto wiring and things like component at what the wide and the prominence

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,500
of the use of water and it isn't the amount of configuration which we actually put I did not examine

20
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,450
our individual is very minimal.

21
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,170
And I talk when I talk about a big spring application probably I'm talking about some hundred and fifty

22
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:54,040
lines of x in the configuration or something like hundred lines of Chamba contribution.

23
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:59,630
What are we talking about is quite a minimal thing so it's not really as important decision to make

24
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,870
as it was before the use of annotations before the use of annotations.

25
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,640
We had to write big big spring application context exemplified.

26
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,060
So you have to define the beans define the dependencies.

27
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,470
Fire them in all that work you have to do that in the economy.

28
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,300
But with all the wild and things like that you don't really need to do that to the amount of population

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,950
that we do in Africa or our configuration is very very less.

30
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,570
Actually there is very little to choose so whether you'd want to do the job configuration or similar

31
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,040
configuration you're good to go.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,700
You can actually use either of them.

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,160
I don't really have a preference among them but would springboard and springboard having this awesome

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,120
annotation at Springwood an allegation and it automatically launching the context up as soon as I put

35
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,270
a configuration on something it would be picked up as spring configuration.

36
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,290
If I have to use SML with sping boot then I have to do a little bit more configuration.

37
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,850
So I prefer not the Jabo configuration especially in spring boot applications because I don't really

38
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,320
need to do any configuration at all all that I need to do is put that configuration on a bean.

39
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,970
Where did this spring configuration.

40
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,180
Then it gets picked up automatically.

41
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,480
If you can you're just being good.

42
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,860
And this was not clear to you.

43
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,300
That's not a problem at all.

44
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,520
We'll discuss that a little more when we talk about tippling boot in one of our subsequent sections.

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,740
For now the important thing is there is hardly anything to choose between assembling our configuration

46
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:30,860
except when it comes to being good applications where Jaba configurations are going to get picked up

47
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,140
and I have a preference for using our configuration.

48
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,390
And then the next step.
