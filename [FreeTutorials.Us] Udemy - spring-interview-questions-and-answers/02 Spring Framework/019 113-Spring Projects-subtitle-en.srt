1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,550
The last step will look different.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,780
Bring more dudes on the spring.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:12,970
Models have the same release version as the Spring Framework so they are almost like they are part of

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,340
the Spring Framework.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:20,470
There are other things spring does other than the Spring Framework and it's modules these are called

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:28,720
spring projects these spring projects provide solutions for different problems faced by enterprise applications

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,520
in this review.

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,290
Let's look at a few of them.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,060
Let's start with spring.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,490
What is one of the most popular books were developed micro services today.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,200
Within a few years spring boot has become the most popular framework used for developing Microsoft releases.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:51,810
Spring what makes it very very easy to develop applications quickly with just like start up projects

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:01:00,670
auto configuration actuator Springwood makes galloping applications especially Microsoft resus of coke.

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,780
The other important spring spring project is doing cloud.

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,350
We know that the world is moving towards the cloud right.

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,000
Everybody wants to deploy their applications in the cloud and therefore it's not sufficient if we don't

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,740
have good applications.

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,380
We have to develop our native applications.

19
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,700
We would want to be able to dynamically configured applications we would be able to dynamically connect

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,110
them.

21
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,790
We would be able we would want to be able to dynamically deploy applications cloud they do applications

22
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,580
need a lot of different features.

23
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:36,160
So if you have a Microsoft Office which is D'Erlach be using spring boot you can use cloud to cloud

24
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,810
enable my groceries bring data provide a consistent data access.

25
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,790
If I go a few years back there was only one kind of databases that we typically connect to.

26
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,090
We were going to do a proper school database.

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,580
Today there are bendin of North equal databases.

28
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,880
We have a mix of data sources so we have noise.

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,770
I mean we have a wide variety of noise levels.

30
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,670
We have high school databases as well.

31
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:10,000
How do you ensure that the way I'm accessing data from all this stuff is remaining consistent that what

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:18,060
this data aims to solve to bring integration on the other hand addresses problems with application integration.

33
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,940
There is something called enterprise application integration patents.

34
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,490
It's a very famous book.

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,460
Spring integration implements the patents which are recommended in the spring integration helps us in

36
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,030
connecting enterprise applications ready very easily.

37
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,220
Not all processing is done online.

38
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:43,840
Some of the processing is also done in batch applications batch applications have their own requirements

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,420
like for example I would want to be able to restart a bad job from where it failed or I would want to

40
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,900
be able to track down exactly what's happening in a batch in much much more of my new detail.

41
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:01,750
Spring Bache provide those kinds of features it enables developing batch applications very easily.

42
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,240
Security is one of the important part of galloping applications.

43
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,630
You'd want your applications to be secure whether you are developing a web application whether you're

44
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,450
looking at rest service or anything that you Delap you'd want to protect it.

45
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:21,810
So Spinx security provide solutions for securing your applications whether it's a web application or

46
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:28,720
whether it's the rest that is Spring has support for multiple security being Security has support for

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,200
multiple security options like basic authentication or thought integration or what do for example being

48
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,960
hate with enables you to develop hato is compatable services interest.

49
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,090
It's not sufficient if you just returned it.

50
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:49,990
You'd also want to return the related links that would help the consumer to understand where to go from

51
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,300
here saying hey do it would help you to do that very easily.

52
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,690
What we are looking at are sound of the spring projects they're just touching the tip of the iceberg.

53
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,210
There are a lot of those spring projects like spring webservices spring fashion spring social spring

54
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,580
mobile and spring.

55
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:12,670
Android which are solving problems in various different places has not really restricted itself to just

56
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:18,000
disappearing from work and got involved in a lot of wide variety of projects.

57
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:24,160
All this stuff you are learning as part of this printing course would also be useful when you are developing

58
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,920
on any of these spring projects.

59
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,170
And then the next step Boing.
