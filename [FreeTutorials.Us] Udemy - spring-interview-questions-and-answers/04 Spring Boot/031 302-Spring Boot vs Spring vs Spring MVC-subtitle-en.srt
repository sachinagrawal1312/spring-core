1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,860
Before we get much further into spring boot you'd want to understand how it compares to spring.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:15,570
Spring is actually spring spring spring and we have clear well separated responsibilities and each of

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,960
them are independent to us.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:24,730
So with application we would use Spring spring NBC and spring but all of them together and we would

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,550
use spring board to configure spring and spring and see if that's confusing.

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,490
Let's make that clear in this video.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,630
Let's talk about spring.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,560
What is spring.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,970
Spring as we talked earlier the most important feature is dependency injection.

10
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:44,260
Right so all that is at the core of everything related to spring is this concept of dependency injection

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,940
and you'll see in mission control application context.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,840
In fact that these are really the fundamental concepts in spring.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,490
So what does being aimed to do if you have a class like this.

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,560
Well this is tight coupling because this is of tightly coupled to this welcome service.

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,820
I cannot have that.

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:11,070
So what I would do is I would actually have to ride on there and thereby would be able to unit test

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,360
the specific controller much more easily.

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,730
So mid-spring would be able to introduce dependency injection and would be able to do unit testing very

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,990
easily as well.

20
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,530
The first thing that being helps us do is to write loosley couple accord.

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,400
The other problem that's being solved is the duplication of code.

22
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,750
So if you look at being JVC it reduces the amount of code that you would need to write by almost certain

23
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:41,730
papers and because it reduces all the noise that the exception an exception handling code and also all

24
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,970
the code to set the parameters in all the code to dig details out of the results.

25
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,140
All of that it removes and it only leaves the crux of the business logic in there.

26
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:58,650
Eliminate all the plumbing code and duplication code and also the problems being solved is good integration

27
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,420
with other frameworks so if I want to use cloud to know my web application or if I want to connect to

28
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,860
hibernate in my web application spring provide very easy integration with all of them if I want to connect

29
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:16,180
to James or if I want to do transaction management has really good support to all that kind of stuff.

30
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,210
Basic problems being solved is dependency injection by bringing in loose coupling and also make the

31
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,400
application testable.

32
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,510
It tries to remove the problem of duplication and plumbing code and it has really good integration with

33
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,240
other frameworks.

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,620
Now what does being SBC do to bring him in.

35
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,970
He actually provides a great way of helping you were web applications.

36
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,840
So it provides a decoupled way but simple concepts like dispatcher so late model and users.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,860
It makes it very easy to develop web applications.

38
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,450
All there's a clear separation of concerns with spring NBC makes it very easy to develop their applications

39
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,090
and also it helps us let's say if I want to switch from JCP to some other thing for a view it's being

40
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,590
MVC it's a very easy thing to do.

41
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,790
Now where the spring would fit in spring boot or let it tries to do is all the configuration that is

42
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,720
needed based bring into being NBC it will try to eliminate that.

43
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,190
It will be limited by this feature called auto configuration.

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,060
So what does it do say is there is no need to configure a dispatcher said with an auto configured for

45
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,640
you there is no need to configure data are not allowed to configure it for you.

46
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,400
There is no need to configure entity manager or factory or transaction manager as well to configure

47
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,010
it for you and it will also define a default component can as well.

48
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,990
Thereby it makes it very very simple to drill up spring and spring and easy applications spring boot

49
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,640
aims to make it very easy to develop spring and spring and VC applications.

50
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,260
How does being good do that things in this way.

51
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,420
So when somebody adds in a spring and besieger can bring some intelligence into it.

52
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,880
When somebody add a hibernate What can I do something more automatically.

53
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,340
So what does it look said defraying books which had available at declasse but so it looks at different

54
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,110
books in the class but and also existing configuration which is provided as part of the spring context.

55
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,860
And based on this springboard provide something called auto configuration.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In this video we looked at what is the role of spring.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,950
What is the role of sping NBC and what is the role of spring board until the next video.
