00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:09,100
Welcome back in this section we would start discussing about the questions related to spring but.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,900
We'll start with these questions in this review.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,570
What is being.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,010
What are the important goals of really good and what are the important features of spring.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:24,140
Typically when we look at Spring applications as being MBC applications they have a lot of configuration

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,310
that is needed right.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,030
For example let's talk about being in VC.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:34,760
You need to configure a dispatcher servlet you need to configure a component Can you need to configure

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:42,190
Buras all were if we would want to use static libraries like bootstrap then we would need to configure

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,500
Bebb job so that we can deal with the static content.

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,900
And also when we configure security there are a lot of things that we would need to configure.

12
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,170
So typically this kind of configuration it might be done in Java code using configuration or this can

13
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,920
be done in an application context example.

14
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,520
So either way there's a lot of conflagration that you would need to do before you can get started with

15
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,030
your application.

16
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,960
In addition to this probably you would want to configure error controller to handle exceptions that

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,790
happens and things like that.

18
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,800
So there are a lot of configuration that you would need.

19
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,720
The other factor is also the fact that we are moving a Microsoft.

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,980
Is this all the architectures are moving to make those services and we do not have a lot of time to

21
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,340
set up a lot of micro services right.

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:34,280
If instead of one big application I have 20 smaller micro services then I don't have a lot of time to

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,480
set up each one of them.

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,350
I would want to be able to quickly get up and running with the application.

25
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:45,680
I would want to start running the application and focusing on the business logic I shouldn't need to

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,700
focus on all the technical stuff of how to configure things and things like that.

27
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:56,030
What are the goals of Spingold the goals of the most important goal of scoring goals is to provide a

28
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,290
QuickStart to spring projects.

29
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,430
If I want to create a new spinning music project I should be able to start doing start developing it

30
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,770
within half an hour.

31
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:12,140
Or if I want to set up J-P to connect to a database I should be able to set it up in another half hour.

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,640
The most important goal of spring.

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,640
How does being good achieves that is by being opiniated so it makes a lot of exemptions about how things

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,540
have to be done.

35
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,670
It takes an opinion and price to implement it.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,920
But the most important thing is you can actually override the opinion so springboard provides options

37
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,400
where you can actually change what is configured by default.

38
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,560
The other goals of springboard are related to non functional features so it aims to provide a lot of

39
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,620
functional features like monitoring error handling and things like that.

40
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,750
The last goal of spring boot is no.

41
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,290
Generation Zero code generation as I call it.

42
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,570
So there is no coordination at all.

43
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,160
As far as being Booby's concern what are the important features of being.

44
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,310
Or have the most important features of springboard is something called auto configuration.

45
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,950
We look at auto configuration.

46
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,410
Indeed did in a later we do.

47
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,880
In a nutshell it's basically when you add a specific jar into the class.

48
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,310
But let's say I'm adding a stinging message into the classpath.

49
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:26,000
Springboard can look at it and recognize the fact that spring is in the class but it would automatically

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,740
configure all the things that are needed to do that application.

51
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,240
So you could configure a dispatcher servlet resolver.

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,220
It would also can configure a message converter and all the things that are needed to doubtable web

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,230
application are configured automatically.

54
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,040
And this feature is called auto configuration.

55
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:53,110
If you add in a web application that spring Bebb jar then you get the configuration related to web application.

56
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,840
If you add in a J-P let's say a hibernate just in.

57
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,610
Then you'll get the configuration that is related to connecting to the database so it would create a

58
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,780
data source.

59
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,240
It would create an entity manager or factory and all the other stuff that you would need to be able

60
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,800
to connect to a database with ease.

61
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:16,050
You see the other important feature of spring boot is something called Spring boot start a project to

62
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,050
look at data projects in detail a little later.

63
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,350
Or start a project provide a QuickStart to different types of applications whether you would want to

64
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,750
open up a web application AJP application of episodes application or whatever other applications you'd

65
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,790
want to dial up.

66
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,510
Spring would start a project provide you a quick start to it.

67
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,190
Springboro actuator helps you in monitoring your application.

68
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:46,970
It exposes a lot of details about the application so that monitoring it becomes really easy.

69
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,880
The last feature about building boot is embedded Sellwood.

70
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:59,070
So with Springle applications you can embed the server inside the appliable job.

71
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,710
So things like Tomcat JT they can be included in your jar file.

72
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:12,460
And when you actually run the application on the server you don't need Tom-Kat installed separately

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,500
because despite of your application will discuss about this concept of embedded in detail a little later

74
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,230
respin in this video we took a quick look at what is being Goodwater its important goals and what are

75
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:32,630
the important features really cause about all these features in detail in the next few years.

76
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,310
Until then.
