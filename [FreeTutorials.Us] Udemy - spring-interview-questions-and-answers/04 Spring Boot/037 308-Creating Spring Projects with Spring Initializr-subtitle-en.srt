1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,750
In this video will focus on something called spring in what being laser What can you use it for.

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,680
What kind of projects you can create using spring initialiser.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,230
What is the fastest way to create projects with spring and spring.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,030
Those are the things that map to just one answer.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:27,780
Sping initialiser espying initialiser is basically a tool to create a spring projects spring into place

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,220
that is that dot dot dot dot you.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,930
Once you go here you'll get to choose what is the dependency management tool you would need to use.

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,460
So what is the dependency management tool you would want to use.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,530
I'm using Maiman.

10
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,670
You can say I want to create a job project the other languages which are supported are clean and groovy.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,270
So I would want to create a job project.

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,380
And you can choose which version of springboard to use.

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,960
So you can choose any of the questions which are available in here and you'd be able to define what

14
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,260
the group idea and idea packed already up to your project.

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,290
The most important thing is you get to choose this style.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,890
So we talked about a lot of different starters earlier or later verb or I would want to use JP I'd want

17
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,330
to connect to JMS.

18
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,460
I would want to add in sping security.

19
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,610
You can add a lot of dependencies like this.

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,080
If you don't know what dependencies are available in here you can actually switch to a full version

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,230
and just go further down and you would be able to see support for a lot of different things you can

22
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,740
add aspect oriented programming support you have web application support.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,220
You have Jesse Jackson today will be a restful Web services with Jack's address.

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,740
You have support for yours.

25
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,050
You have a lot of different things related to sequel.

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,900
I mean which do in memory database JTB CJP and all that kind of stuff so you can add in all the dependencies

27
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,120
that you would need to want there is support for school as well.

28
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,940
And we also talked about streaming cloud so all the stuff related to spring cloud.

29
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:00,040
Also you can add in from here and last but not least is actuators.

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,030
You can also add actuator and the documentation for actuator as well.

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,050
So you can add in what are all the dependencies that you would need and you can click Genndy project.

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,290
This would generate a project for you with all these dependencies present in and you can just import

33
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,100
that project into eclipse and start working with it.

34
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:26,860
Bring initialiser is a place where you can create your spring projects very easily.

35
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,780
It would create a project based on your choice.

36
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,600
And you can import that project into your idea and very easily use it until the next video.

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,040
All right.
