00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,710
Welcome back in this video we would talk about it.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,770
Why is that so important.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,430
What is it.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,050
But it's well it's good.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,640
And what the other.

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,950
And what it said was that I supported race being.

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,700
So why does the concept of that so were very important.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,010
Think about this.

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,870
Now we are moving towards the world of Mike services and we are developing a lot of small applications.

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:32,830
So to deploy this more applications on the server we would want to have as less prerequisite as possible.

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,150
So if I have a server let's say a unique set of which was already installed.

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:43,390
If I have a web application which needs Tom-Kat then first thing I need to do is to install tomcat on

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,590
the so I'd I would need to install Java.

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:51,420
Then I need to install tomcat and then I would then be able to install IMAP location.

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,260
But even before installing the application I need to reconfigure the server with all the stuff that

16
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,760
I would need to do.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:05,620
So is a lot of steps that is involved in doing all this stuff in stuff that we can use embedded in the

18
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:12,200
concept of limited so what is basically that US so what is embedded as part of our application.

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,780
So the server is directly part of your job.

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,080
So the Tomcat for example is directly embedded into your job.

21
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,810
So if I want to run this application which is present in Java I don't need or Tomcat so because it gets

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,340
a what is inside our job.

23
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,460
All that I need to do is have Jalla on that machine too if I want to double up.

24
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:40,360
So if I want to deploy this application onto a deployment and we run into let's say I'm going to deploy

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,790
this application into Kubik and we are creating a cube box fresh all that they need to do is install

26
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,760
Jalla there.

27
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,280
That's the only thing I would need then I can go ahead and start running this job data down there because

28
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,670
they can't get what is already part of our job.

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:03,650
The concept of embedded server makes it easy to deploy our applications into the deployment in one big

30
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,470
cloud.

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,780
We would want to be able to easily create a new environment and remove Abbaye environment as in when

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,800
we need them.

33
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,640
Concept of embedded.

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,560
So what helps us do that pretty easily because we can take any system which has just job on it and deploy

35
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,250
that application and start running at the end of that so it removes the need to have so pre-installed

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,710
on the deployment and we don't mind the default embedded server for spinning boot IIS.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,440
Don't get hurt.

38
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,670
It's been good also has support for D and underdo as the embedded.

39
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:44,600
So the thing is Spingold start up web is the startup which we would use typically to develop applications.

40
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:53,070
And this doctor has a data dependency on springboards started to get that Tomcat is the default dependency.

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,920
So if I want to switch trajectory or under to what I would need to do is first I would need to exclude

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,910
the static Tomcat.

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,520
So independence is a good start of web.

44
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,870
I'm excluding springboard Dr. Tom.

45
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:14,140
And then I'm adding in the dependency on JT so I'm adding in the JT style.

46
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,400
Similarly if I want to switch to underdo or that I need to do is instead of Jaydee I need to use and

47
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,220
go in here in this step we talked about embedded server.

48
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,430
Why is it important.

49
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,460
What is the default embedded server and what are the other ones which are supported by spring.

50
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,550
And then the next video we.
