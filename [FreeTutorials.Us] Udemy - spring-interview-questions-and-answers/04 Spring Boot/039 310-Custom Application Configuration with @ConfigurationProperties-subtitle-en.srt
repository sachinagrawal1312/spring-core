1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,630
Well you come back in this we will look at something called externalised configuration.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,860
We would want to add custom application properties to our application.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,990
We learn how to do that using suppling wood and also we look at something called a configuration property

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,820
so these are all the questions that we would answer in this busy week.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,600
We do.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,420
So how do we actually the configuration using spleenwort in the earlier video.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,730
We looked at application properties.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,410
So properties is the fundamental way to extend lazed configuration.

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,300
And you can also use yammered syntax in application.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,920
Yeah.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,760
So you can use application properties or you can use application but YAML YAML stands for yet another

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,840
Markup Language O'Hehir instructing logging DOT level dot org that's being claimed book is called the

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,820
debug thing.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,320
Logging level args being claimed.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,030
But this is more readable format.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,140
Even a human would be able to read this and understand this.

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,810
For example in the earlier one we said Abdur name is good at this and description is this but Indiamen

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,040
This is how it would look.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:15,330
So app name description so almost like a hierarchical level you can use the Ammann are properties.

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,570
Either of these are good approaches to configure your application when you're developing your application

21
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,810
you'd want to have a few custom properties.

22
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,540
This is very important because some of the times your configuration might change from environment when

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,580
you meant for a specific feature you might want to enable it in their environment but disable it in

24
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:43,170
Kuwait or you might be trying out some features in your data which you'd want to turn off in production.

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,180
So in all these kind of situations externally configuration actionless configuration plays an important

26
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,660
and externalise configuration we are talking about in here is not really which is already made available

27
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:00,330
by spinning the things which we are talking about are ones which are custom So based on our feature

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:08,870
requirements how do we create our own configuration properties the way we can create configuration properties

29
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,130
in applications is by using at configuration properties.

30
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,920
Here I'm giving it a name basic.

31
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,820
So if I want to configure de-value for this I can do that is basic don't value basic message basic garden

32
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,480
number so I can configure it in application properties using that.

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,520
Now this is how you define your properties but how can you make use of these properties.

34
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,210
It's very simple game.

35
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,400
All you need to do is not a wide and basic configuration in.

36
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,160
So this is basic configuration that we have defined in here and just Arto wiring it in.

37
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,010
And I can make use of configuration not get message configuration or get number configuration.

38
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,030
That is when you know all the values from here can be made use of in our.

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,830
Here we are making use of it in a simple restful service but you can use it in any of the early years

40
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,020
whether it's a business leader or natally or audio over.

41
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,500
So this is how you define your properties this is how you make use of your properties that are configured

42
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,220
and this is how you configure your properties you are setting value is going to do messages going to

43
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,500
a number is called 200.

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,480
This is how you do it in application properties.

45
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,610
If you're using application or Yemen it's much more simple it's basic value through message and number.

46
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:30,750
So this enables us to be able to define custom application properties.

47
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,220
The most important advantage of the custom property route is the type safety.

48
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,740
So here I am trying to set a value of basic dog number to a value of ABC whereas if you look at our

49
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,300
configuration basic That number is a number.

50
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:53,040
So when I tried to set a string value to it there would be an exception application fail to start.

51
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,090
It this failed on what property value or type so and so which requires a type int.

52
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,290
I was not able to convert this ABC to.

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,310
That's basically what it's the good practice which we recommend for all applications which are based

54
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:14,770
on spring boot is the truth configuration properties to define all user application configuration.

55
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,250
You'll be making use of certain features from sping boots so those things you can anyway configure through

56
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:25,040
application properties but those properties to which you which are specific to your application which

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,460
are specific to your features that you are helping in your application.

58
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,940
Always use configuration properties to define them so you can have one being like this.

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,500
Hi.

60
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:41,930
Radke So here we have basic conversation probably you can have something like application configuration

61
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:49,860
indeed in which there is a hierarchy of beans which you can use to configure your application in this

62
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,200
video.

63
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,550
We looked at how Quixtar unlace configuration using springboard how well you can define custom application

64
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,000
properties using springboard.

65
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,990
And what is the use of configuration properties in the next when you will look at how to define different

66
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,060
values for each of these properties in different environments and building next video by.
