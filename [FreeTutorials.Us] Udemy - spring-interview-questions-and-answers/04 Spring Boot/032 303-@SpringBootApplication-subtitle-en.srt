1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,970
This would you we would talk about something called at springboard application.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,530
So if you look at any springboard application this is the annotation which will be present everywhere

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,990
right on top of any good application class.

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:22,480
At the root is this thing called springboard application and we use this application to launch up the

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,450
entire application.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,340
Here we are seeing spring application that ran this class and we are able to do that because this is

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,500
a spring board Application class.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,240
So what are the features that Pingu application brings in.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,020
That's basically what we would look at.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,080
So if we look at being good application there are three important things that it does.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,730
Number one it has springboard configuration.

12
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,300
Second it is enabling auto configuration.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:00,080
Third it does a component can Springboro configuration tells that this is a configuration for springboard

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,170
application.

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:07,840
This is very similar to the ED configuration annotation that we use in us putting context right in spring

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,370
applications we use at configuration.

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,260
So Spingold configuration is just an enhancement of that.

18
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,720
So this tells this good application is going to create a spring context.

19
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,750
That's basically what it tells us.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,410
The second thing which it does is they enable auto configuration.

21
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,950
So what happens with Springboard is you would want to configure based on whatever frameworks at present

22
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,660
in the class.

23
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,830
But this feature called auto configuration needs to be turned on.

24
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,940
So who is doing that.

25
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,920
That's done by the spring board application.

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,170
In addition it says that enable our configuration to auto configuration is turned on.

27
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:53,210
The last thing it does is also component can this being what the application is in this bag.

28
00:01:53,230 --> 00:02:00,120
Cage so it automatically turns on a component scan on this basically bad case.

29
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,570
So what.

30
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:08,350
There were things that you have in this package directly into all the files which are under this package

31
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,730
so this rest for web applications in the package that's full of services that they package it in.

32
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,400
So everything in this package will be scanned for components and all this stuff would be big deal.

33
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,890
So I don't need to explicitly define a component.

34
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,430
I'm basically a Springwood application creates the best framework for spring Buddh.

35
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,080
So it says there's a spin configuration it enables auto configuration and it enables a component.

36
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,850
And until the next week you were way.
