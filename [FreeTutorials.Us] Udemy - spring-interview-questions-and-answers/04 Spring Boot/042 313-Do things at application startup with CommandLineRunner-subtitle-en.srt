1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:07,200
The last topic we got good that we would be talking about is what is command line run.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:14,690
So if you look at the documentation it says it's an interface used to indicate that a bean should be

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,080
run when it is contained within this being application.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,400
This is a little cryptic to put it in layman's words.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,240
This is something you can implement the command line written it and implement a bean.

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,330
Then you have to implement something called Amendment that what would happen is the app at the application

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:37,100
startup wants the application Quantic sping application context has launched up then the code in this

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,070
method would run.

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,750
That's as simple as that to implement a command line.

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,070
So you have to implement it.

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:50,930
You have to implement a call command line runner and implement a method call on the arguments which

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,670
are passed to this method are the same arguments that are passed to the main method to start running

13
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,750
the application.

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,960
So if you are running good application as a job application and there are a few arguments that are passed

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:08,270
the main method to that application those arguments are also passed in to your command line and run

16
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,590
the command line.

17
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,690
Rene is very useful if you want to do something at the application startup you want to populate some

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,050
data all you want to configure something.

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,770
Those kind of stuff can be done in the command line and run them.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,880
What you are looking at is an example of a command line and this is called the user repository command

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,600
line.

22
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,660
And yet all the wiring in a user depositary in here.

23
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:38,100
As you can see here it implements the command line interface and it implement the arraignment code.

24
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,540
And what we're doing in here is we're saving a few ways users don't so we're creating a few new users

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,500
retrieving the user by ID and also doing a find all.

26
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,000
So we are actually doing some simple logic in here.

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,470
But the most important thing the fact that all the code.

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,000
What are you creating here would run one the application context test launched up.

29
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:06,860
So if you implement common labor and implement the method which is present in there and run all the

30
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,690
logic which is pleasant and it would be executed at the launch of the spring context within spring but

31
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,580
that's basically what command line that is all about.

32
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,960
So if you have some logic that needs to be done at application startup this would be one of the best

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,170
places to implement it.

34
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,240
And then the next week you may.
