00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,370
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:09,010
In this video we'll talk about profiles how you can define beyond for a specific profile and also how

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,660
you can create application configuration for a specific profile.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,230
Typically when we develop applications we deployed them in different kinds of environments.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:23,860
Right dev Kuei stage production your local environment as well so you have multiple environments in

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,170
which you applications can be deployed and the application configuration in each of these environments

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,660
will definitely be different.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:38,380
So how do you handle those changes the way we would handle them is by something called a profile.

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:44,800
Springboard has this concept called profile built in profile is the way we can answer the question how

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,280
do you have different configuration for different environments.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,220
The way we can have different configuration for different environment is by defining individual property

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,720
files for each one of them.

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,780
So all the common properties you can define in application are properties if you want to override any

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,070
of the properties in a basic neuron.

15
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:12,580
So let's say I want to override the properties in Dev and I can create application and properties in

16
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,300
Q8 application and create the properties.

17
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:22,000
So once I define this property the only thing I would Naden need to be doing is to set that profile

18
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:28,210
for that environment run into if in the queue when we don't mind I would want to make use of application

19
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,500
and Quader properties whatever it is defined in there.

20
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:36,610
Then I would need to set a profile of Q8 for that application.

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:43,690
How do I said this profile of you where I can set the profile of keyway by either when you're launching

22
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:49,000
up the job application Springwood application as a job application you can passing an argument saying

23
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:57,010
hey the spin that provides active is equal to you can say if it's cute or in application properties

24
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,130
application that properties file itself you can just print out profiles or the active cycle queue.

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,860
These are the two ways which are present where you can set a profile and based on the profile which

26
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:16,540
is present in their appropriate file from the application properties is pick up.

27
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,450
This allows us to configure different values in different environments or do you need to do is change

28
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,230
the profile.

29
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:31,540
So if I'm in production outside a profile of Prod. if I mean Q8 had the profile of Q8 as simple as that.

30
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,040
As we discussed earlier based on the active profile appropriate configuration is beat up whichever thing

31
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:44,050
you said that the active profile it will be used to pick up the appropriate configuration and profiles

32
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,900
can be used to configure different kinds of resources.

33
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,160
Right.

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,240
I what I talk about an application you'd have application related configuration as well as the resources

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,600
that the application Cemex do.

36
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:02,320
So things like databases queues external web services that you might be using all that might be different

37
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:02,910
from one.

38
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,200
And we don't mentor another and you don't mind all those kind of things can be configured in these different

39
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,060
files.

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,820
And as long as you can figure out that specific profile for that specific environment you are done.

41
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,130
Good what is a profile look at how to create application configuration for a specific profile right

42
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,190
to education configuration for specific profile is created by creating a property for it.

43
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,950
One important thing that you can do with your profile is use your profiles in code to define your beans.

44
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,670
So this dev being here has an ET profile annotation with the value div.

45
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,540
So this being will be only available in the profile div here.

46
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,740
This particular bean will only be available in a profile of Prod. so you can customize.

47
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,220
Even Java Beans will be available based on the specific profile.

48
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,440
While this might be looking like an interesting feature I would actually recommend against using it

49
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:06,010
because this might if you have been like this defined between different environments that are radically

50
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,350
in your code then your code is becoming specific to a specific and you don't mind.

51
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,570
I don't really like that unless it's absolutely mandatory.

52
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,300
Find a word using this kind of stuff in your code.

53
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,880
In this video we talked about profiles and do the next video.
