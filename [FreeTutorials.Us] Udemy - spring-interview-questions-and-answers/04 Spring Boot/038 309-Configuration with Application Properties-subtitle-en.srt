1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,080
Well come back in this way.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:09,320
Let's look at some of the important things related to application or probe by piece.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,810
What is that position or properties What are some of the important things that can be customized in

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,850
application or properties.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,010
Let's get started now.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:22,730
So what is application that properties application properties is just something like a property file.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,420
Right.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:30,150
In spring if I open a application that properties I'd be able to configure a lot of different things

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,250
I can configure the lobby level up the application and I can configure either use which I would want

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,490
to make use of in the application as well.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,780
Another example of the application that properties from one of our web services applications.

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,380
So if you look at it we are setting the be able to debug.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,750
We are setting how to do this realization.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:01:01,060
So you're saying don't see the latest date time stamps read Day Test Data not us not names stamps and

15
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,460
we are also disabling management security.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:10,630
So if you look at actuator actuator we look at it in one of the subsequent steps by default.

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,870
When you add in actuator the securities enable.

18
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:20,280
So here we are just turning it off temporarily and other things that we can configure in is what should

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,720
be the username and password for security.

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,010
So if I'm turning basic security on here it's false but if you turn it on and you add it's being security

21
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,030
then you can set what should be the user id and password.

22
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,010
We are here we are setting it to use that name and password.

23
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:41,070
The other thing which we are configuring in here is we are setting choice to true.

24
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:47,100
So when any query is fired through GAAP then that Asgill will be printed to the log.

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:53,680
And also when we are using Jaypee and we are do as in memory database we can enable the hishe to control

26
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,900
what we are showing in here is some of the important things that can be configured through application

27
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,670
properties.

28
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,280
There are a huge range of things that you can configure to application properties.

29
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:11,940
A few other things which can be configured through application that properties include logging file.

30
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,410
So where should your logging file be present.

31
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,970
What should be the name and what should be part of it.

32
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,740
And also logging level we Lubet earlier so it can be debugged in four trees whichever level you would

33
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,070
want to set it to.

34
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,970
And also if you want to exclude certain auto configurations then you can configure that to application

35
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,200
properties.

36
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,000
You can configure the profiles that should be active through application not properties as well we'll

37
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,250
look at profiles a little later.

38
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,550
You can configure the error but by default they are about a slash error.

39
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,600
So if you want to change that you can configure that too by default as being good application launches

40
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,980
up on ADHD.

41
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,880
You can change that by configuring so weatherboard by default the HDP converter which is used for Jaison

42
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,100
is Jackson.

43
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,740
So if you want to use Jewson you can map that in here as well.

44
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,000
The thing is application that properties is the central place where you can configure a lot of things

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
related to springboard.

46
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:15,260
If you do a google search for springboard application properties you'd land up on an appendix.

47
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:22,990
This appendix contains all the common application properties that are present in spring boot you would

48
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,570
see that this is a huge file.

49
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,100
So if you were really interested to spend some time looking at all the properties which are present

50
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,360
in this file it will take a long time pleasing properties is basically used to configure your springboard

51
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:43,610
application so that you make use of all the configuration for all these doctors had to ramp application

52
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,580
properties.

53
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,780
And we looked at some of the important things which can be customized through application that properties

54
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,120
and in the next video play.
