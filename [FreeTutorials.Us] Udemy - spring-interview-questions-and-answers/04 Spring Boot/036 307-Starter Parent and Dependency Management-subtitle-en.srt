00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,160
Welcome back.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,620
And this video we'll will talk about something called Start a period.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,880
We look at what are the different things which are pleasant and start appearing and also really understand

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,310
how being good and for this common dependency management for all that study projects.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,680
Let's get started now.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,270
If you look at a spring springboard application application which is Darel abusing sping what you would

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,230
see sping would start appearing present in there.

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:34,060
So it's the parent form which is used in almost all springboard applications.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,540
If you look at springboards start a parent you'd see that it has a parent on its own.

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,720
It's called splitting dependencies and it defines a lot of different things the different things that

11
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,880
D-Star appeared in defense.

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,490
We already looked into what dependencies being present at the top.

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,710
You can also see that it defined the D for Joe Walsh.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,890
It defines the encoding of the project and also defines the source and target for the completion.

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:10,550
But the most important part for us being would start appearing is this dependencies parent because the

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:18,070
springboards dependency parent is where all the versions of dependencies define.

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,880
So when you're using sping boot you don't need to define the version of any of the dependencies because

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,530
all the versions I defined in displaying both dependencies.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,650
So if I'm using E.H. Gesh 3 then the version is defined in here if I'm GFC This is the question if I'm

20
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,810
using Tomcat This is the question.

21
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:43,410
One of the problems I used to frequently face before I use Springwood was what question off the dependencies

22
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,990
would play together very well.

23
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,850
So if I'm using a specific question or spring then what version of hibernate validator should I use.

24
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,560
What version of Jackson should I use.

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,850
What version of JFC should I use.

26
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,300
What question of sibling security should I use.

27
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,770
That's always a confusing thing because you don't know when there would be conflicts.

28
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,830
So you have to do some kind of a trial and error and figure out what are the compatable versions of

29
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,990
different free works.

30
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,960
That's what springboard eliminate.

31
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:20,580
By use by specifying all the dependency worshipped in springboard dependencies it says OK you as a programmer

32
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,090
you don't worry about the wash ins you just say what you need.

33
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,300
I know what all the compatable motions so inspiring would be dependencies all the wash for more than

34
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,780
250 jobs are defined and all the portioning is taken care in there.

35
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,170
So I don't need to worry about which wash to use all that I need to tell Springboro is I want to use

36
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,790
Jackson that's it I don't need it diversion to use.

37
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,240
I need it.

38
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,630
I want to use security based on the washiness being I'm using it would automatically configure the right

39
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,890
spring security for me.

40
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,840
All that features sping would get through this thing called sping would start happening.

41
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,580
So what we look at in this particular video is the fact that shipping would start appearing depends

42
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,560
on spring boot dependencies.

43
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,560
I mean it's been good that the parent has another Parent called Springwood dependences and Interlingua

44
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,730
dependences.

45
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,300
We manage the versions of almost all the dependencies that would be needed to develop springboard applications

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,190
and then this in this database and we define the Java wish that we would want to use.

47
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,300
Which question would you want to compile the Java code.

48
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,650
And then the next with you.
