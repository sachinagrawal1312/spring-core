1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,620
Welcome come back in this with.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:09,250
Let's look at auto configuration and also how can you find more information about the configuration.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,150
We have been talking about our contribution a lot since we started with spring board and we'll be talking

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,990
a lot about it because this is the most fundamental feature of spring.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,330
Right so it's being bought looks at frameworks which are available on the classpath and all the existing

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:29,460
configuration of application based on which would provide the configuration that is needed.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,900
Develop an application with the supreme books.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,800
This is basically what is our configuration.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,160
So springboard autoconfig good stuff based on what I wear glasses are available in the class but that's

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,980
basically what we're job at available in your dependencies.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,580
It took at the start up log.

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,140
If you look at the start up blog you would see something called Dispatches 7 that it's mapped to slash

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,530
it's mapping slash error on to a space which thinks it's mapping this last object and something of that

14
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,290
kind in there as well.

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,740
So all this is a result of the auto configuration been Boots's.

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:09,290
There is a class called Dispatches overlaid on the class but so it configures a dispatcher servlet it

17
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:15,050
sees that I'm trying to develop a web application and then it can be good error handling thing as well

18
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,940
for.

19
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,440
So this is demand for English and we have been talking about it a lot.

20
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,490
How does all the configuration work.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,000
So where is a configuration implemented.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,430
The Octagon provision is implemented in a jar called springboard auto configured or job.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,740
If you look at your dependencies there is something called boot or to configure Baer's underlings.

24
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,380
You're using Dunja and all.

25
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,190
Here is the configuration for all the different things that spring board works with.

26
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,700
So you can see a lot of packages which are present in here.

27
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,350
Look at the configuration related to AB.

28
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,860
If you look at the web package there are a lot of auto configuration which is presented for web as well.

29
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,090
So you see a controller and you'll see error MVC or auto configuration.

30
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,430
You see the HDP message connectors for just on auto configure.

31
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,070
You can see Jackson HTP message converters are configured as well.

32
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:19,530
These they use to translate or can what you were just on to beans and beans to Geass on as well as you'd

33
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,020
see dispatches servlet auto configuration similar to this.

34
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:30,030
There are a lot of packages where the configuration for all the other stuff is defined as well.

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,520
So you can plug and play around with this being able to configure out and try and figure out what's

36
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,490
happening in there to understand what about auto configuration when springboard launches up to look

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,000
at all the auto configuration things which are present in here and fires which of them are matching

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,330
the conditions.

39
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,290
So you can see this is conditional on class this being available.

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,970
So if this class is available this article configuration will be fired.

41
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,160
So it is conditional on missing bin.

42
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,810
So if this bean is not there then configure this in these all these gases within the conditions when

43
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,640
each of these configurations are really good.

44
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,520
If you want to understand our country curation in depth one of the things you can do is good application

45
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,740
that properties and turn on debug logging all here.

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,550
I've turned on the blogging for my application for the Spring Framework.

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:32,550
If you don't need on then you would see something called an auto configuration report that is printed.

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,340
So you can see all the information that we're seeing right now is because of the auto configuration

49
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,440
we pulled to the auto configuration report shows.

50
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,720
What are the positive matches which of which are all the other configurations which were configured.

51
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:53,060
And also it shows what the other things that were not matched as well it shows that negative matches.

52
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,210
These are the things which do not match.

53
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:01,340
These are not matching because of a specific condition it shows the details of all that as well.

54
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:07,980
The other way you can look up auto configuration information is by going to the spring board actuator.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,630
So if you go to the entry point of spring boot actuator localhost ADHD application will look we talk

56
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,560
about being good at it a little later as well.

57
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,230
The thing which we wanted to focus on is the auto configuration which is present in here so if you go

58
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,350
to auto one figuration you'll be able to see all the details of what these autoconfig that you'll be

59
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,520
able to see that the specific Beanie's are configured and why.

60
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,580
So you have to do that just as well as you have something called negative images.

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,820
Search for the matches.

62
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,640
You have both these details present in here.

63
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:46,790
In this way we try to get a big picture of photo configuration or the last few video as we understood

64
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,240
what our configuration is and indeed we do.

65
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,000
We focused on finding more information about auto configuration we talked about the fact that to find

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,120
more about our configuration I can go to the jobs being built configured or jet and all don't debug

67
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,580
logging on or Also I can use being.

68
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,940
She waited until the next studio.
