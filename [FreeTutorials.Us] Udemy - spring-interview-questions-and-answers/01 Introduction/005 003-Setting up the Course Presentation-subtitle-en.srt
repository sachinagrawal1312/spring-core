1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:08,960
It this way you will help you set up the presentation that we would be using in the course the presentation

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,520
which we are going to use is in our get her repository in 28 minutes.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,890
Springing up you gay.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,520
So if you are down there what you can do is you can click on or download if you are familiar with it

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,660
then you can do a clone.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,810
If you're not then probably downloading does it is the best option for you.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:33,170
So you can download the zip and zip zip file to of all the click download it will download a zip file

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:42,330
downloads folder and unzip it to some folder on your local hard drive and zip zip file to this folder

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,560
so it's been in your guide master.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:52,540
And if you go to the presentation you'd be able to see a file called spring in question started.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,810
See what you can do is you can drag it and put it in your favorite browser.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,270
So let's drag it and put it in my browser and do so.

13
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:07,800
Launch up the presentation what you can do here is just press F..

14
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,740
This would start the presentation in full screen.

15
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,830
All you have to do is press F and you can see all these slides of this presentation.

16
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,240
The first few flights are the introduction to the course.

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,240
After that all the questions the code snippets which would be using and the presentation instructions

18
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,170
everything would be present inside the presentation.

19
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:39,640
And if you'd want to move out just skip it would take you out of the full screen mode so as to enter

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,440
the fullscreen mode escape to get out of it.

21
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:48,770
And if you press escape again it would show kind of the index as Skip Skip.

22
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,480
It would show the index so that you can easily navigate through these slides.

23
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,030
Have you set the entire presentation up.

24
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,810
You can also navigate by typing the slide numbered in the browser so no Amant slide number 200 or if

25
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,070
I would want to go to 300.

26
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:13,510
I can go there so you can see that there are quite a lot of flights which are present in here.

27
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:19,080
In total we have about three hundred thirty one light which would be going through during this code.

28
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,340
I'll see you in the next you.
