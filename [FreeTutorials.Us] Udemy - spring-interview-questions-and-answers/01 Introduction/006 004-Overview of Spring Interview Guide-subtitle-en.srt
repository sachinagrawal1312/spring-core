1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,190
This with you let's get a quick overview of the order in which we would be approaching different things

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,710
in this court.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,360
One of the important things is you can keep around like you would want even though we go in a specific

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,810
order we would start with spring spring NBC and then go to Spring Springwood and so on and so forth.

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,580
You can actually directly skip to spring but if that's the topic you are really interested in the order

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,010
in which we will be covering topics in the discourse.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,740
Our roots start with spring.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,240
Because about the basics of spring like loose coupling dependency question of control application context

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,920
actual application context job application context and different.

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,540
In addition to which I used in spring we talk about the default school.

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,430
We talk about different types of injections set an injection and construct injection.

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,620
And we would talk about how to debug problems with springform book.

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,110
We would talk about primary at qualifier annotations.

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,530
You talk about the new features into pling framework.

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,390
What are the different spring model to represent what are the different spin projects which represent

16
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,200
and we would end D.S. giving you a big picture of the Spring Framework.

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,200
Understanding why is it popular.

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,400
In the next section we would move into spring and we see what we would be talking about is the basics

19
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:26,010
of our pictures of web applications model one model to model different controller and things like that.

20
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,630
After that we would talk about the basics of spring and we see a simple flow in spring NBC we talked

21
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,430
about Dispatches several that you resolve with a moral model and view and how you map requests.

22
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,130
We also talk about validation and form backing objects.

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,010
We use Binding result to do our validations and we'll all to talk a little bit about being formed X

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,680
and model in-session and after that we move into a section on springboard.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,510
We try to understand the different goals and features in spring but we're trying to compare spring with

26
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:08,580
spring and spring and we see we talk about other projects or configuration spring initialiser we talk

27
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,370
about profiles and also about actuator and we'll end this section by talking about command line.

28
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,520
Run them in the next section we would go into database connectivity.

29
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,990
We talk about these things we see and g.p we talk about entity manager persistence context the different

30
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,550
types of relationships in Jaypee and all.

31
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,960
How do you configure GPA.

32
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:35,220
One of the important things is this kind of an all of U.S. I mean that it needs a really detailed cost

33
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,230
to go into the details of everything related to GAAP.

34
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,950
So this kind of giving you an all world view of Gippi while still staying in touch with how you would

35
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,120
use spring to connect to GP in the next section we would be talking about sping data.

36
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,360
What is the need for spring that what is being AJP And what are the different kinds of repositories

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,440
that are unpleasant.

38
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,950
That we would move into unit testing.

39
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,670
We would look at three example unit tests.

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,890
One is using Machi my favorite mocking work as well as the default mocking cream book with spring but

41
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:14,160
we would also look at how to write a unit test with Mark NBC and also how to write integration test

42
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,590
with spring boot.

43
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,950
After that we would move into AOP understand the different concepts which are related to ERP like aspect

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,610
bind code and different things like that.

45
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:31,080
We'll also understand the most popular AOP from book Aspasia and compare it with the spring will.

46
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,590
After that we moved into a section on topup services.

47
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,950
We would talk about the contract first approach of developing web services with spinning Web services.

48
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,890
We talk about the different content related to superb services so so peda so bored the soap envelope

49
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:54,160
and things like that along the W-S DL Xs D Jax be in point and we also talk about message dispatches

50
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,520
that we end with the section on press for that.

51
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,080
So he says the world is moving to its macro so he says and this will web services play a key part in

52
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,490
that.

53
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,070
We'll talk about what is best what are the key concepts in designing.

54
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,610
Let's Philippe and also the best practices related to them.

55
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,140
We look at creating gate and portmanteaux what on the sort and also what are the different response

56
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:23,600
state to Sissi should respond back for those requests that we look at had Dior's have to document a

57
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,220
restful Web services using swagger.

58
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,450
We understand what is in negotiation and also understand how to add similar support for your restfully

59
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,630
Web services.

60
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,540
Along with discussing about the best practices related to exception handling and worshipping that really

61
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,950
a wide range of topics that we would try and cover during this court.

62
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,870
So you can feel free to skip around to the section that you would want to do first and then feel free

63
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,220
to skip around to other sections as well in the next week.

64
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,960
We would start with discussing about the basics of spring.

65
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,520
Well until then.
