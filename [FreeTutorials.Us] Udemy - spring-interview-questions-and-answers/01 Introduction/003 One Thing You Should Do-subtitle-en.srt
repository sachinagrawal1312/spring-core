1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:08,170
You come to this course from in 20 minutes I can tell you that in 2018 it has 90000 blistered and six

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:14,410
doesn't find it place five star reviews on our courses and all 10 hours of content in this course.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,880
But these numbers do not make a difference to you and your learning unless you make the best use of

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,070
discourse.

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:30,450
We recommend you to set one goal for yourself and commit at least 28 minutes a day to learn something

6
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,050
new.

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,730
I am of course kidding.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,030
I'm a great believer that if you learn something new for at least half an hour every day you'd reach

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,620
the top five percent of any career that you would choose.

10
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,260
And 28 minutes was disclosed this domain name I got.

11
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,930
Now the story you set yourself a goal and the reward.

12
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:58,140
Now I will tell you why this call should be what you should be doing for that Haffner you have committed

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,390
65 percent of the new Java projects use spring and spring.

14
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:03,930
Good.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,370
A big chunk of that is Flippy's web services and micro services are being built with spring and our

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,680
spring springboard.

17
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:19,230
Three hundred percent is the increase in number of micro services that are being built with springboard

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,280
in the last two years.

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:29,010
Seventy percent is the percentage of real world projects using Mavin to manage dependencies and get

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,180
as Washington control.

21
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:37,200
I would recommend forking the repository of the course and I recommend you like it do to make me happier

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,840
in the world of my growth.

23
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:48,050
This is where we create a number of small micro services and that's what we do in this course do we

24
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,730
create a number of small projects to ensure you have the skills to set up a new project from ground

25
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,610
up.

26
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,710
Now in this video with a couple of recommendations.

27
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,810
A big chunk of the audience for this cause is starting to put in the initial part of the course.

28
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,720
We repeat a few important concepts.

29
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:14,760
If you are an experienced programmer have some patience for the first hour or so and we should be good

30
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,720
to go.

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,900
The important thing we would want you to know is that you retain 90 percent of the concepts.

32
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,890
If you watch the videos.

33
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,390
Do these steps along with me and repeat it again.

34
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:35,950
If you made it here its time to open up your calendar and reserve at least half an hour to learn every

35
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,480
day.

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,990
Good luck and I'll see you in the next week you.
